"stayed at the monaco on my way skiing at easter & loved it. staff were helpful & friendly, room was huge with fantastic view of the river. central location, 5 min walk to the el. adjoining restaurant/bar, great food & service. i have stayed in more expensive, supposedly better, hotels in chicago, but this is the best. thanks monaco, i'll be back.

"the hotel was not one of the better ones i stayed at. the room was seemingly nice at first, but after staying there for a few days it seemed like the cleaning staff never came through to clean it. i had the same sheets for a three days before i called and requested they be changed. also, the walls seem to be paper thin and you can hear what is going on in the adjacent rooms, which interfered with my sleep. i ate at the primehouse in the restaurant also, and asked for a well done steak, and the steak was still pretty pink on the inside and lacked flavor. this is definitely not a hotel i would recommend to anyone.

"i truly enjoyed my stay at the omni chicago hotel. we stayed in a suite, which was clean and extremely nice, at a very reasonable rate. my husband and i spent quite a bit of time in the indoor pool, but personally i preferred laying out on the sundeck. service was excellent; they were friendly and all of our needs were met promptly. i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to have a great experience in the downtown chicago area.

"i was attending a training conference in chicago and opted to book my own room thru one of the online discount programs rather than stay at the rather sterile and pedestrian hotel where the conference was being held. i booked 4 nights at the intercontinental and was pleased with the elegance and convenient location (an easy walk to the conference). from the lobby to the rooms, this hotel lives up to it's storied reputation. (the indoor pool seems to be imported from the set of a busby berkeley movie!) and even tho' i was there for a conference, the hotel's location on the mag mile and a quick jaunt to restaurants and theaters, made for a very pleasant stay at a very affordable price.

"my daughter and i woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. when we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. i then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool, one white phone and one emergency red phone, to call the desk. both were out of service!!!! i am glad there wasn't an emergency. as we were exited the pool area i ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean.... never heard back.

"this was my first time in chicago and i tell you they really made me feel like a million bucks. i took a taxi straight from the airport and was greeted at the door by a kind gentlemen who offered to help me with my luggage and assisted me to the check-in counter. i made my way up to my room, which was spectacularly bright and well-lit, then i ordered some food. all in all the food was delicious and the staff were fantastic. if i didn't have such a short stay in chicago i would have stayed in my hotel room all day!

"the amalfi hotel has a beautiful website and interior decorating, but that's about it. when my wife and i got here, we were given keys to a room that had not even been cleaned! the internet access promised on the hotel's website was down, so i couldn't catch up on any of the business i had intended to do, and my wife thought that the dark design details in the room made her feel claustrophobic, like she was sleeping inside a salvador dali painting. all in all, this hotel was not worth the money, especially since we spent most of our time enjoying the city--something more casual and comfortable would have been better, and it would probably have been cleaner, too!

"the allegro in downtown chicago is a great stay/ part of the kimpton group boutique hotels the allegro offers a classy stay in a beautiful room for a moterate price/ they offer complimentary and decent wine gratis in the late afternoon and the hotel allows you access to everything the loop has to offer in this remarkable city. i would recommend parking outside of the downtown area and taking the 'el' into the loop which leaves you about 2 minutes from the hotel/ otherwise you are looking at hefty parking fees for a car you dont need in this part of the city . the rooms are small but beautifully done with great colors,comfortable beds and in my case great views. if you go to kimpton group website and sign up for specials you will be alerted to great rates on certain days / kimpton does a great job and their properties are 'class acts'

"i booked this hotel for a business trip since i was able to get a $129 rate on travelzoo and figured i'd save my company some money. i had also read excellent reviews on tripadvisor. i had a guaranteed and confirmed room reservation for two nights in november. when i arrived in chicago at 7:30pm i decided to go to dinner prior to checking in so called the hotel to request a late check in and was told 'no problem.' when i arrived at the hotel at 11:45pm i was told they didn't have a room for me and that i'd have to move to the four points sheraton which they paid for. it was a major inconvenience to have to move and completely unacceptable that my confirmed room was given away. i was told that they overbooked and didn't get as many cancellations as they expected. i did check into the hotel the next day and once there did have a good experience. i would recommend staying here but do ensure that your reservation is indeed confirmed and avoid any late check-ins or you might not have a room! the 'experience designers' were great and very helpful. the rooms were very nice and comfortable (felt like home). the breakfast could stand to add on some bagels for the 'healthy factor.' it was nice that they did have fruit. i think that once the kinks are worked out that this will be a great hotel--they just need to get the basics down!

"this is a beautiful hotel with a great view of the chicago river and a short walk to all the best places to visit in the city! i had an unbelievably pleasant and relaxing stay with an in-room massage and fantastic room service. if you're looking for a vacation in chicago and want to experience the best the city has to offer as well as live in luxury and comfort, i highly recommend this hotel and i would definitely come again!

"outmoded and worn furnishings combine with some poor original design choices to produce a drab place to stay. this hotel's five-star rating needs a downgrade! when i visited this hotel 14 years ago, the fairmont was among the classiest brands. no more. my 29th floor room was expansive, but dark -- only one small window and one light was not working. the upholstery was frayed, the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water, and the room's door didn't close unless you pulled on it in a certain way. worse, the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you, with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser. it was like sleeping in an old vending machine, but when i looked for a pen to take a phone message, there was none to be found. other reviewers remarked that this hotel 'needs updating,' but i think some of the original design choices are also to blame. for instance, someone decided to place a series of heavy doors in strange configurations. i couldn't sit on the toilet without leaving the door to the toilet cubby open -- the space wouldn't accommodate my legs. (i am not unusually tall.) there are so many great hotels in chicago that deserve five stars, that the fairmont shouldn't be able to compete. see my profile for better ideas. niftyc

"i really had high hopes for homewood suites when i stayed there on a week-long business trip last month. after all, considering their prices (it's technically a hilton), you would expect something above and beyond a typical cut-rate bargain motel. i'll start with the good stuff about the hotel: it's in downtown. now for the bad stuff: first, everyone is rude. i'm not sure if management intentionally hires rude people or if the poisonous culture inside the hotel grinds otherwise decent people into cynical pulp. the bellboy scowled at me in the lobby, was rough with my luggage, and then scowled at me again when i tipped him $5. likewise, the receptionist seemed flustered and in over her head. she had to call her supervisor over *twice* just to check me in, and i had a reservation! apparently she was new, and didn't have much experience using the computer, but that's no excuse: it turned what would have been a two-minute process at a decent hotel into 15 minutes of tedium. sadly, the room was no better than the service. the hot water in the sink did not work, the shower was only lukewarm, and one of the bulbs was dead in the light fixture above the sink. complimentary mood lighting, i guess. the tv was a bust; sure it was an lcd, but the espn logo at the bottom right corner of the screen was burned in and stayed there on every channel. and to top it all off, the bed smelled funny. i called the front desk (at least the phone worked), and asked for fresh sheets. the person i talked to said they'd be right up, but never came. eventually, i gave up. i woke up the next morning to back pain (the bed was about as firm as a marshmallow). i left the room, and made my way through the chilly hallways to the 'complimentary buffet.' literally all the food was bad. even the cereal tasted stale. looking around, everyone in the dinning room appeared to be having a similar experience. the sight of two-dozen disappointed people sipping weak coffee and prodding watered-down scrambled eggs with plastic forks was a sight more becoming of a refugee camp than an expensive hotel. just plain sad. worst part was, it was the same thing for the next four days, too.

"i unfortunately stayed for 3 nights at the knickerbocker hotel ...i should have checked out on day 1. the bathrooms were filthy dirty with tangled hairs on the floor behind the door and after a few nights of scratching and the feeling of skin crawling...i pulled the bed away from the bedhead and watched as little rice sized brown bugs scurried over the white sheets...bed bugs! which i might add the hotel are saying are flying insects from the windows being left open from when the window cleaners were there (fortunately i took photos to the contrary) finding the bed bugs...i looked at the mattress protector and pillows and found long hairs on both...i was disgusted at the hygeine and would never stay again at this establishment.

"the chicago hilton is a great hotel our stay there was fantastic. the hotel is placed in the heart of the city were you can find it a easy walk to almost everything from the local colleges to the great restaurant that surround the city. the room itself was clean and the staff was fun and helpful. i can't really say anything bad about this place it was a great time and a great place to stay while we were there.

"i stayed at the intercontinental during the last weekend in september for a 'pleasure trip' -- the intercontinental was in a great location and the staff was excellent. the room was clean and comfortable -- and came equipped with a new lg flat panel tv. had breakfast at zest (hotel restaurant) -- a bit pricey but decent if you want a buffet. the hotel is in walking distance to millenium park, museums and the aquarium. there is also a lot of shopping - window shopping is best though, considering the sales tax is 9.5%! (and possibly raising to 11%) great stay. i highly recommend it and would stay there again.

"i was very disappointed with the hotel this time. they seem to be coming down in quality quite a bit. the clientele also seem to be of a lower quality. the lobby was quite a rambunctious scene with no one on staff seeming to notice. the house keeper only did the bare minimum in the room each day and did not replace the used toiletries or the coffee; she also left the dirty coffee cups in the room. i think i will have to stay with the intercontinental next time.

"we always stay at the sheraton chicago hotel & towers when we take our kids to the city. you can't beat the location which is in walking distance of navy pier and michigan ave. the hotel is also just a couple of blocks from the fabulous fox & obel, a high end grocery store with many prepared items available to go and a great cafe that serves a stellar breakfast. the hotel staff are professional and courteous and the rooms are more than adequate with very comfy beds. my kids enjoy the pool with it's windows that overlook the chicago river.

"i stayed at palmer house for one night in early january this year. during the check in, the front desk lady asked me to show my confirmation letter of my reservation. i did not bring the confirmation with me because i had not been asked to present it in other places during check in.so she asked to print out one copy in their business center and bring the confirmation to the bell station to get the room key. i did what she told me and went to the bell station. however, people at the bell station was totally confused and none of them have the key. a bellman was nice enough to help me go ask their staff at the front desk. i finally got checked in after waiting at the lobby for about 15 minutes. as other people pointed out before, the room i got was small and old with a twin bed, and i could hear people next door using the bathroom. this was not a pleasant experience, even though i paid over 100 dollars to the hotel.

"we had the pleasure of enjoying a stay at the affinia chicago hotel. we found it conveniently located on e. superior street, near many local attractions. the rooms were modern chic with a very urban feel. the pillow menu was awesome, my partner and i have such different preferences, the choices made it easier to sleep like we were at home. the hotel room layout was comfortable and spacious with all the right touches to make our stay perfect! i couldn't believe the amenities available to guests. my beagle, betsy enjoyed her stay at the 'jet set pet' care center. she was pampered as much as i was. it was such a comfort knowing we could bring her along and that we could enjoy our stay without the stress and concern that comes along with traveling and pet ownership! another feature i personally enjoyed was the walking tour kit. it included an ipod shuffle pre-loaded with a workout playlist, a deck of cards; guidebook that included walking tours, and comfort items like a towel and map! i felt like i was the most important guest (surely, everyone felt that way as they checked in to their rooms). highly recommend to anyone who has the opportunity to travel in the area of an affinia hotel!!

"no excuse for a hotel like this to have cold showers on three consecutive days and then to tell customer that engineering will look at it and that we should have told them sooner. i wouldn't expect a cold shower at a budget hotel, let alone an omni. great location and the bar is nice.

"well, this used to be a le meridian hotel, and it has changed for the worse. we kept having to remind them we booked a package, because we were being over-charged separately for everything, when it should have been included. we were supposed to have champagne in the room upon arrival, and did not. two phone calls and three hours later, it finally showed up. we tried to have a drink in the bar, and even though we were the only people there, three servers/bartenders came and went, talking to each other, not one of them acknowledging us. after ten minutes we left the hotel and went down the street for a drink. and don't bother to pay extra for 'city view'; because you may get the view we had from only the sixth floor, looking across the street directly into a plain brick wall - that is all we could see. oh yes, the valet lost his cell phone in someone's car, and called me at home today to see if we found it. he wanted me to call him back at home. nice of the hotel to give out our personal information to the staff, huh? for the money, stay at any other hotel in chicago with the same price-point and it will be much much better.

"the james hotel is located close to everything in chicago, the miracle mile, pizza house uno,rush street, the water tower everything. we walked everywhere because everything was close by. the rooms are very modern and a little on the small side. but the bed was very comfortable, very! the service is very good and the calls are answered professionally and nicely. all service was very fast and through. the lobby is a liitle small but that keeps the riff raff from hanging out in it, the bar service was good. the drink prices were high but what do you expect in a hotel bar. i got a great deal from leading hotels of the world for my stay of 3 days was just over $400.00 for a 5 star hotel that's cheap. due to the location, price and service i may stay there again. but i think my next trip may take me to trump's hotel in chi town. the james is a good stay . the doorman at the hotel are great! always pleasent, with a smile and very good service.

"i had to write this review! my tired body walked through the doors of the fairmont. it felt like i walked through heaven's gates, the lobby was majestic and the staff was so friendly, that i was instantly energized. the front desk staff was very helpful and quick to find my reservation and get my bags up to my room. they were so nice to inform me of the health club and spa..oh those wonderful spa treatments that are offered are incredible, i took advantage of a soothing pedicure during my visit (my very first) as well as a massage. i was amazed at the size of the meeting/conference room that we used for an afternoon. the room was so clean and the bed was better than the one at home. the food downstairs in the restaurant smelled so good that as tired as i was after the meeting, instead of room service, i went in,and the food was mouth watering delicious, and the wait staff was very hospitable they take great pride in everything, even the wake up call was friendly. my stay was so great, that i want to go back again soon!

"this hotel is amazing, i would recommend everyone to stay at least one night here if they had the chance. i stayed here on my first honeymoon and they had all the accommodations i expected plus more. i was floored by the friendliness of the staff and they definitely went the extra mile to make everything perfect without any hassle. the restaurants at the fairmont were amazing as well. when staying at this hotel, food and wine at their best are portrayed. if i had to make the choice to stay here again, the only thing that i would do differently is schedule the stay to be twice as long (it was so relaxing!!). already booked another stay for next year i enjoyed it so much.

"the affinia in chicago obviously caters to wedding guests and corporations hosting business conferences. if you do not represent one of these groups with a large number of guests and revenue for affinia, do not expect any measure of customer service and don't expect great accommodations, even at their high prices. when we arrived our reservation was lost, then it took forever for the concierge to tell us the room we were instead given was available. the furnishings in the room were cheaply made, the cleaning obviously superficial and our view was directly into the concrete wall of the hotel's l shaped corridor. i called for fresh linens and toiletries and a very rude phone attendant told me someone would essentially be then when they had time. two hours later someone came. the dining hall and reception areas were really nice, but again, unless you're a large group don't expect to enjoy them during your stay at affinia. even if you could, the prices wouldn't be worth it.

"while overall a decent property, the incident i had with this hotel has been like none other in my history of travel. i recently stayed at the hotel monaco for five nights, checking out on monday, march 19th. shortly after leaving the hotel and retrieving my car from the valet, my partner and i noticed a large scrape on the bumper of the car that wasn't present upon checking in. we had not requested use of the car for the duration of our stay. i called the hotel approximately two hours after checking out and was directed to speak with the garage manager at park one (their valet company) who stated that he would review video of the car and call me back within 48 hours to verify that the car was unblemished upon arrival, and was scraped upon departure from the garage. the garage manager, mike yunan, didn't call back until i had an email exchange with the general manager of the hotel, marco scherer. when he finally got back to me, the garage manager stated that he would file an 'incident report' and claim with his insurance company, travelers, which would eventually deny the claim because garage staff wouldn't admit fault or liability, nor did they supply the video they stated they had of the car entering or exiting the garage, which could have verified that the damage wasn't present upon check-in, but was at check-out. their insurance representative even told me that the garage does not have surveillance at that location, contradicting the garage manager. in the end, this kimpton intouch guest got stuck with a $1,000 bill for parking at this kimpton property: an almost $500 paint scrape on top of a $48/per day parking fee, rental car expenses, several hours of lost time in dealing with the issue, and one gigantic headache. in the end, do not trust the valets or staff at this hotel, and take your business elsewhere if at all possible.

"this is an absolutely exquisite hotel, at a great location, and boasting superb amenities. i was here on a personal trip and really enjoyed being so close to the shopping on michigan ave. the hotel itself has a pleasant ambiance and the staff made me feel welcome and quickly responded to my requests for various items from the front desk. i appreciated the homey, well-designed interior and views of the city. it was also nice to have good food at my disposal late night so i didn't have to wander the city for my late night meal. this will definitely be my hotel of choice when i return to the city.

"stayed at the chicago hilton for three nights and from the minute we walked through the door i was very impressed. check-in was quick, easy and i was very glad that we were able to check in despite being earlier than the advertised check-in time. we were given a twin room with two bathrooms which was brilliant. it made getting ready to go out much quicker! the hotel location is great opposite the park, which is a must see. although located on south michigan ave it is easily within walking distance of all the shops and sights of the whole of michigan ave. would also recommend the street one block back from michigan ave for good shopping. for breakfast i would recommend grabbing a muffin, croissant or bagel from the bar just past reception rather than going for the more expensive breakfast in the restaurant. for evening entertainment kitty o'sheas is a must. typical irish bar with good drinks and live music. finally the bed at hilton chicago is the most comfortable bed ever. i would have taken it home if i could! definately made for a good nights sleep.

"i was on a business trip to chicago a while back and i had the unfortunate luck of staying at the intercontinental chicago hotel. i say unfortunate , because from the first moment i walked in my experience was poor. the front desk made me wait a very long time and i had to resolve an issue with my reservation. my receptionist had made the reservation and the room should have already been on or company account but they were insisting that i supply a personal credit card for the room. i understand their precautions but i travel a lot and usually do not encounter this situation. once that was all taken care of (several phone calls later) i was taken up to my room. it was nice and i was glad to finally be there, but the bell hope was very short with me and was very quick to throw out his hand asking for a tip, even though he had done nothing but groaned the entire time he was taking me to my room. i was very happy i only had to stay there two night because after my run in with the front desk i got the impression that no one wanted to deal with me. i will hopefully not be staying there again, and will suggest that it be avoided by all.

"sometimes you just can't find fault with a hotel, even if you tried. such was the case with sofitel, where we'd never stayed before. it's a sleek, modern, sophisticated hotel with european touches. we spent three days there on a leisure weekend, we had a 29th floor king room looking directly at the hancock building, at a total cost including taxes and lugs of about $165 a night. the room was average sized, well-appointed, everything in it worked, and it had a fabulous view of the chicago high-rise jungle, including snippets of the lake. the public areas were wonderfully decorated. the restaurant served a good breakfast at, for chicago, reasonable prices. the staff was excellent. my wife broke her ankle several weeks before we visited and was on crutches. the staff loaned us a wheelchair and was very helpful in assisting her.

"avoid the talbot, especially for group functions. my in-laws spent a great deal of time trying to find just the right hotel to use for our wedding party and several out of town guests. they were lured in by promises from the talbot, that since they were a small boutique hotel that they could provide 'special, personal treatment'. nothing could have been further from the truth. they failed to honor two requests to keep the bar open after our reception, they persistently confused reservation requests, they front desk failed to contact the valet despite multiple requests and nearly caused of my guests, his wife, and his two year old daughter to miss their departing flight. now the worse part. mistakes are made, even hotel managers are human, but where a hotel, which is supposed to be in the hospitality service, can distinguish itself is in how they handle and correct the error. case in point: i had requested on several occasions when i made the reservations for my family that they all be placed under my credit card, all expenses, they assurred me that this would be no problem. of course, when my brother, his wife, and asthmatic five year old arrived to searing hot and humid chicago after six hours of travel they wouldn't let them check in until they physically saw my card... again despite them having my card on record, and despite my explaining this to them over the phone. my brother recalls the 'indignation' of the desk clerk when he mentioned that the charges were to be put on my card. then another guest, in this case my older brother, came by and put the charges onto his card so that the five year old could escape the heat and the prolonged waiting in the lobby. when i finally was able to get across town, leaving a cubs game early, i again spoke to them about putting all the charges on my account. again they agreed, but never did anything about it. in the end when my older brother checked out on sunday he was told everything was alright, but when he went to his atm his account was frozen from 'unathorized overuse'. the hotel kept billing his debit card automatically for multiple charges ubtil his account was essentially drained. when he got home he had to take an entire day off to discuss with his bank how to rectify these events. i spent sunday afternoon for an hour and three hours on monday, the first two days of my honeymoon on the phone, calling the talbot, the credit card fraud division, my brother, etc trying to solve this situation. the most aggregious insults continued to come form the covering manager, who at one point suggested that 'i was mistaken about coming back down to talk with the desk clerk about these matters'.... this was a witnessed event, and her insinuation was that i was lying, and that there was no way her clerk could have made a mistake. in the end, there is no one running this place... managers from one department refer you to the manager of another departments voice mail. when i was finally able to get the name of the general manager (after two days)m neither he nor his assistant would ever call back. the communication between the staff and mangement is non-existant. fortuneatly the staff at the signature room (where we had the reception) was beyond excellent so the day was not lost, but the the talbot went out of its way to insult and poorly serve my family and many of our wedding guests. try the ambassador east (same neighborhood) cheaper, much more professional staff.

"my in-laws booked a one night stay for new years eve for the two of us to stay at the james. to be brief there were a few things wrong with our stay which will prevent us from returning and advising our friends not to stay there. 1) shoddy construction of room fixtures: ceiling light was missing leaving a fist-sized hole with wires exposed, both towel racks fell off the wall without being touched, and bathroom door often came off it's sliding mechanism with gentle use. 2) when we reported these problems, employees simply put the towel racks back on the wall without properly adhering them to the wall. 3) upon check-out, they did not have record of my in-laws paying for our stay, though it was noted on our reservation that they had made it for us. we had to pay for our ($300) gift and the in-laws were extremely upset. when we wrote a letter to management (as a manager was not available to speak with us when we left) we did not receive an adequate apology.

"i have stayed at the palmer a half dozen times in the past and it has been ok. the main drawbacks are the check in desk is always slow and they charge you to use the fitness center, which is truly annoying. in addition, there are so many rooms you often have to walk a hundred years to find your room once you get off the elevator. other than that, it is a classic old hotel with some yesteryear charm. but, the room they gave me most recently was so small it was laughable. the door to the bathroom could not open as it hit the desk, and the chair to the desk could not be properly pulled out as it hit the bed. there was no room for them to put the tv in front of the bed, so they shoved it off to the side. room 23242 makes prison cells seem roomy and i promise that no one who works there would ever put someone they know in this hovel. it should not be sold as a hotel room.

"don't let the website fool you. i stayed at the amalfi hotel chicago on my last business trip, and this was probably one of the worst 4 star hotel i've ever stayed at. the website makes the place look like a 4 star hotel but it's more on par with a 2 stars or 3, if you want to be generous. first off, the rooms are not as nice or clean as they look in the picture. the room that i checked into was dingy with paint peeling from the walls, and the carpet looked like it hadn't been vacuumed since god knows when. since i was only staying one night, i decided not to ask for a different room- although i don't know if asking for a different room would've made any difference considering the lack of hospitality from the reception desk. when i arrived, there were two receptionists chatting it up- no acknowledgement, no prompt service. i had to wait about 3 minutes although i was the only one in line before any of them acknowledged me. and no, they weren't talking about hotel matters. i'm not a difficult or an especially picky person, and who doesn't chat during work with their co-workers but for them to completely ignore and make a client wait for 3 minutes shows serious lack of professionalism. do yourself a favor, and go stay at the marriott if you want service- unless the price is tempting but you get what you pay for.

"the ambassador hotel is located in downtown chicago right off lakeshore drive in the heart of the hotel industry downtown. i would recommend you look to one of those other hotels if you are wanting a place to stay downtown. the rates at this hotel indicate that it would be a top of the line place to stay, when in fact, we had a pretty unpleasant experience. it started with someone who was obviously a new employee checking us in. i have no problem with this, except the fact that this person was the only one on duty and had difficulties checking us in and had no one to assist him. after checking in, we went up to our room and were a bit disappointed. the pictures do not accurately depict the size of these rooms, they are very tiny and offer very little room to store luggage where it is out of the way. the beds were not very comfortable and when we called room service for extra pillows, they took over an hour to arrive. i will not be staying at this hotel anytime in the future.

"when you check into a hotel after being stuck in a airport, you areusually not in the best of mood. i, working in a upscale hotel, do encounter many guests checking in who this has happened to. all they want is a friendly face and a smooth check in. the desk clerk who checked me in at this property, did neither. she was short, rude, handed me my keys and walked away. i would never go back to this property due to this.

"stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower for 3 nights in early april 2007. very convenient location just a block from all of the shopping on the golden mile. good restaurant at the hotel serving a la carte breakfast different from the usual fare and with a nice french twist. dinner at the restaurant was also good. prices are reasonable. room is comfortable, only problem was with a card access door lock that usually required several swipes before opening. excellent service from the bellmen to the concierge and front desk staff. would definitely stay here again if visiting chicago. concierge recommended a small van tour, which was excellent. however early april is too early to visit chicago as popular activities such as the boat tour of the architecture of chicago was not operating yet.

"when i first made reservations at the palmer house hilton, i was excited because of all the gorgeous pictures displayed on their website. little did i know it was going to be a total disaster. first off, my husband and i couldn't find the place. it was our first time in chicago after all. and when i would call for directions, they just kept putting me on hold. when my husband and i finally arrived, the bus boy was extremely rude. after man-handling our luggage, he held his hands out impatiently expecting a tip. talk about arrogant. the front desk clerk was a little too pushy. my husband and i were only staying one night just to attend my sister's wedding, but they kept trying to up-sell a suite when all we needed was a regular guest room. the room itself was okay, decorated so ornately that they are forced to jack up the price and take all that you're worth. they even had the nerve to try and say that we purchased some items from the 'snack bar' and ordered a movie that i've never even heard of! completely unprofessional. i will never, i repeat, never stay at this hotel ever again.

"as a frequent traveler for both business and pleasure, clean and comfortable accommodations at a reasonable price are important to me. homewood suites chicago provides all of that and more! the room was spacious and immaculately kept, with all the tools you could need to prepare a meal in the full-sized kitchen. after a busy work day, it was wonderful to be able to kick back in front of the huge flat-screen television to relax, with a spectacular backdrop of the city outside. i will definitely book a room next time in chicago and i'll definitely continue to stay at homewood suites in other cities.

"my husband and i stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower for three nights last month. we were celebrating our anniversary, so we decided to splurge on the prestige suite. according to the website, we were to be given either a city or park view, neither of which we had. instead, our room was overlooking a dirty field with some sparse trees. the woman who checked us into our room was rude and impatient, and the man who helped with our bags was the same. when we got to the room, the beds were unkempt and the floors were in serious need of a vacuuming. the bathroom was dirty and there was dried toothpaste in the sink. my husband requested that we be given another room, preferably a clean one, but the clerk told us that there were no other rooms available. if given the chance, i would not stay at this hotel again, even if i were offered a free night.

"we were greeted by staff with excellent customer service skills. our room was such a pleasant surprise, from the flat screen tv, the full size shower with rain showerhead & hand held shower wand, the wall attached toilet with flushing options (on the wall), the comfortable bed, the lovely lighting options, etc.. the size of the room was snug, and very comfortable, as would be, in a historic hotel. it was also quiet, and i know that the hotel was sold out. my sister was in the room next door. we did not hear her tv. we also loved walking less than a block, to the shopping and restaurants on north michigan avenue.

"when i called to edit my existing reservation, i was placed on hold for 30 minutes! finally someone came on the phone and said, 'ill have to transfer you', so i was put on hold for another 5 minutes. when i finally did get to speak to someone, as i was going through my changes, i asked her to send me a revised copy of the reservation to which she huffed and acted very put off. before she was able to disconnect with me, i said 'i have one more question' to which she replied 'i'm working at the front desk and i have customers waiting!' i thought, so am i not your customer? pathetic and rude. hotel better find some better employees for their guests to truly enjoy their stay.

"i arrived here at about 8pm after a flight from california. i didn't know about the renovation when i made the reservations, but that didn't bother me very much. i was helped by a man at the front desk named ben, who was friendly enough, but literally just handed me my room key and told me to have a nice stay. he gave me no information about anything. i had no idea where breakfast was served, or even if there was breakfast. there was also an extremely unpleasant woman working behind the desk(she wasn't wearing a name tag but was african american, slim with short hair) who seemed to be actually radiating hostility. it made me very uncomfortable and needless to say, made me feel unwelcome. i actually felt like i was putting her out by staying in the hotel. i encountered her again the next morning when i had to go downstairs to ask a question and again tried to smile at her a bit, and again was met with utter disdain and rudeness. i also watched her interact with another guest and saw her act with the same rudeness and bad manners. no matter what may be going on in one's life, when you work in customer service you need to leave whatever is happening at the door and put on a smile. i was appalled by her demeanor. my room was alright, there was no clock which i found very odd. since i came from a different time zone my computer and phone had 2 different times and i was constantly confused as to which one was correct, especially upon waking up in the morning. it would have been nice to have a clock. there was also no literature on local sites, maps, restaurant menus, or even anything with the hotel's name and address in the room. also, the mattress was the absolute worst mattress i've ever slept on in my life. i woke up every morning with a sore back and neck. i've had better sleep on a hard, lumpy futon. it was absurd. like another person posted, my tub did not drain either, and i was also shocked that there were no soda machines or ice machines to be found. maybe they were around somewhere, but i wasn't made aware of it at check-in, and i didn't want to go downstairs and ask for fear of being treated like i was a burden to the employees. the hotel is in a good location and the rooms look nice upon first glance, but i absolutely would not stay here again. i've had more pleasant stays at a cheap chain hotel, which was a bummer because it was my first visit to chicago and i had pretty high expectations.

"our stay at the james in late last august exceeded our expectations. my husband was in chicago for a business trip, and i tagged along to have some time away from our day to day life. when we entered the hotel we were greeted acknowledged the minute we walked through the doors, and the staff member at the front desk was extremely friendly. he met our needs in a timely manner and patiently answered our questions. the lobby was clean and the ambiance was impressive. our room was also very clean. i could not have found a better room for those two nights of peace and quiet. the bed was comfortable, and the bedding was the type you could slip into and drift off in. it has been awhile since i have stayed at a hotel where the comforter was not scratchy or too thin. my husband actually commented that he had not seen me sleep that soundly in over a month. the bathroom was also impressive. the water pressure was not something i had to mess with to get perfect, and the heater took no time at all to warm up. even though i had brought my own shampoo and conditioner, i did give the amenities in the bathroom a try, and like everything else they exceeded my expectations. i did not get a chance to check out the conference rooms, however, my husband had nothing but great things to say about the qualities of the facilities. i truly enjoyed the location and ambiance of this hotel, and if we are ever in the chicago area again we will definitely be staying here. this hotel met all of our needs from relaxation to business to pleasure.

"i went to stay in the millenium hotel chicago. now, first, being from rural midwest i was surprised at the price in general, but kind of accepted it when i was assured by my cousin(whom i was visiting in chicago) said it was normal. so i check in, service seems fine. i get checked in, room seems ok. a couple of hours later, a lady comes into my room, not a hotel employee, just some lady. turns out, they cross checked the rooms. we(her and i) went down and complained. turns out they double booked the room, not that they were full, but they were full on that room type, standard, as well as the superior rooms. rather than simply upgrade one of us for the mistake they asked which one of us would like to 'move up'. we argued with them for 20 minutes, they didn't budge, our only option was for one of us to fork over an extra $60 for a corner superior. we(the lady, her name was sharon) decided to split the difference some, she gave me $20 and i moved. i get to the new room about 20 minutes later, nobody, but sharon helped me move. i get there, the bed was thrown together, not made, and the bathroom wasn't clean, the garbage had a kleenex in it(i wasn't going to check if it was used). i called down, it was now 5pm. no answer, i called for 10 minutes and finally got a hold of someone. i told them about the state of my room. they said they would have someone up 'right away'. i waited 30 minutes and a lady comes in, not in uniform, but she did a hell of a job cleaning. she switched out the garbage, wiped out the whole bathroom, vaccuumed around me, and switched out the bedding, all told she was in and out in 10 minutes. she didn't say two words to me, but she did clean. i stayed the night and checked out a 7am and will never go back. ryan from iowa

" if you are traveling anywhere near lake michigan within the next year or less, i would highly recommend staying at the sofitel hotel. unbeatable elegance, fine dining, and magnificent views are only just a few amenities to speak of. along with excellent service and reasonable pricing you will be assured to get a quality nights rest. if there were such a thing as a 10 star rating, the sofitel would surely have it. my visit and stay there was nothing short of elegance and comfort. located minutes from everything in downtown chicago, one would hardly want to leave. fine dining, dancing, and an evening bar will leave you absolutely relaxing after any meeting, or social event in town. the sofitel hotel will leave you wanting to visit the moment you leave.

"i stayed at the sheraton as it was where a conference i was attending was being held. on the plus side, the hotel is reasonably well located, within a few minutes walk of michigan avenue. my room had a superb view out over the river. however, for the price i must say that the room look decidedly shabby and worn and is in need of refurbishment. the decor was dated, and my bathroom unit was cracked and the shower rail rusty. the wifi is ridiculously expensive, and frustratingly as a conference delegate i was unable to use the service downstairs in the venue despite having paid for 24 hours access. there was no wifi in the conference rooms, although it was free in the lobby area should you wish to sit there and do your emails. i know chicago is expensive, but for that price i feel the experience should have been better.

"i traveled to chicago recently with my giant german shepard dog rex and picked the hard rock hotel for the perfect location and because a close friend had warmly recommended their pet friendliness. the service truly is incredible. they even had a web-cam so i could check in on rex while i was out for dinner in the evening and a friendly staff member took him for a walk when i could not make it home from a meeting the day after. the rooms really rock (pardon the pun). nothing like the cheap plastic laminated stained carpet decor so common in other places that allow pets. the easy chair looked so good that i was almost afraid rex would snack on it while i was out, but he seemed to like the guitar chew-toy that came with the pet package better. i would definitely recommend the hard rock hotel to my friends - whether they travel with or without pets.

"we booked a room at the hilton chicago for two nights to stay the weekend, but upon arrival our reservation could not be found. i even provided the hotel with our confirmation number, but it still wasn't available! fortunately, another reservation had not shown up so there was space available for us. once we settled into our room for the night (after a long flight), there was a bad odor coming from the bathroom. apparently the cleaning solution they used was tainted and they had to re-clean it after our arrival. needless to say, with both of these poor experiences in just one night, i will be hesitant to ever stay in this hotel again, let alone any other hilton around. please consider someplace else before the hilton chicago!

"we stayed at this hotel in february 2010. the room was great we had purchased it at a raffel at work for a fund raiser for united way. so we probably paid more then we needed but it was for charity. we were woke up at 3:00am in the morning by a group of at least 25 young people that were so loud coming off the elevators and down the hall ways they must of woke everyone up on our floor. of course one of the rooms they rented was right next to ours. they were so loud shouting profanities and banging on the walls that we thought there was maybe a fight going on. we called the front desk who sent security up immediately. security tried to get the people that were not registered guests to leave. we called down to the front desk two more times to send security back up again since nothing changed this went on for over an hour until it finally quieted down. because of this we ended up over sleeping in the morning since we were so exhausted. when we complained about it in the morning managemnet would do nothing for us because as they stated we used a gift certificate. well we still paid for it!!. they would not give us one thing free for the trouble that we had. we would never stay at this hotel again, obviously they really don't care about their guests.

"i visited the hotel allegro chicago while i was on vacation with my daughter. i booked the room and was very excited because the website alludes to a very lavish interior with amenities far superior to the surrounding hotels. i was particularly excited there was a fitness center because i work out on a regular basis and i would not have to give that up on my vacation. let me start by saying the staff was very rude and i was very dissappointed they could not respect that i was very tired after traveling a very long way. i booked the hotel stay for over a week, which was very expensive, and that seemed to not matter to them at all, despite that fact that i was travelling with a small child as well! they did nothing to accommodate me, and the woman at the front desk even refused rudely to take my calls or answer any questions about nearby restaraunts insisting that even though she worked there she 'didn't know the area' to tope it all off, the fitness center was under construction so i never got to use it. worst hotel experience of my life, i will never go back. - sandy d.

"the talbott hotel itself is a bit worn around the edges. no - not a bit worn - very much so i'm sorry to say. although the location a block and a half from the best part of michigan ave. can't be beat, and the level of service is on par with many four seasons, there were quite a few bumps in the road. number one, the rooms are quite dreary - brown on brown is just so not pleasing. the desk chair was so badly worn that the 'lift' button simply swirled down when you sat in it and no we're not grossly obese. the back of the chair leaned so much it was uncomfortable. my husband had to use 2 couch pillows to use it - one to get him up to desk heighth, one up against his back to scoot him up to the desk. the bathroom was oddly arranged so that the door swung up right next to the sink, so if you were using the far sink and someone needed to enter the bathroom you got hit with the door. the towels were very well worn and thin, although bath sized, which was a plus. the restaurant downstairs is practically another posting - suffice to say, it was horrific. we had some appetizers outside on the nice streetside tables, and they (appetizers) were awful and looked as though a child had tossed them together in the kitchen. a room service sandwich ordered later in our visit was totally wet on the side, served on a large white plate, and was one slice of meat and one slice of plastic american cheese on a grocery store-like roll - very very sad. even the menu, as limited as it was, looked as though someone's child had written it out. the good news is that chicago is a fairly well-read restaurant town so there are plenty of other places to go. unfortunately for us, the 3 days we stayed there was a large convention and jazz festival in town so we paid $325/nt for our disappointments. the good news is that the mini bars' wares were incredibly well-priced - when's the last time you had a $4 beer anywhere in a hotel? (even if it was bud and bud lite - lol!~) the front desk and curbside staff could not have been more accommodating. the water out of the shower was hot and plentiful, and the bed comfortable. the a/c was not noisy nor uncomfortable whatsoever, and we had it going the entire time as it was in the 90's our entire stay. free wi-fi - yes! and it wasn't horribly grindingly slow! no need for the advertised 'upgrade' for faster wi-fi. talbott - please update your rooms and get a new restaurant concept and you will be ahead of the game. apparently there are enough folks getting deals on rooms here so they are pleased, but we were sadly not.

"the location of the hotel is great, right on the river and michigan ave. almost everything is within walking distance. at the price, though, and given the 4 star hotel, we expected better walls. our room was connected to other rooms on both sides by locked doors. the sound from both rooms came in loud and clear. we heard our one neighbor making business deals on his phone (he clearly wasn't speaking loudly), and the other neighbors up at midnight yelling and screaming when they came back drunk. we asked them to be quiet (i shouldn't have expected that to work with some young drunks) then called security, but they did nothing. i was completely annoyed with the noise, especially in an expensive business hotel such as this one. unless you are in chicago to party, get drunk, and not get any sleep, i wouldn't stay here.

"my family stayed at the hotel monaco hotel in chicago from 2-5 september 2011. i have no complaints about the rooms but i do have to complain about the staff in general. when we checked in the lady at the desk was rude to my children, take it they were a little loud but it was daytime and she should have never spoke directly to my kids that way. the cleaning crew the next morning didn't even knock at our door before opening the door. my children were still sleeping and i was in the shower. thank god my husband was already at his conference. the hotel was beautiful but the staff makes for a horrible experience. louisiana resident.

"this fantastic hotel has it all: luxury, an excellent location and a fun atmosphere. the rooms are spacious and well decorated, and the staff is always helpful and courteous. whether you're traveling for business or fun, i highly recommend the hard rock hotel in chicago. i stayed there with my wife recently, we were on a short weekend break and we wanted to enjoy the music an just have fun. the hard rock certainly delivered what we were looking for. the hotel is in a central location, within easy reach of the main tourist spots in the city, however, there's superb food on site and the best entertainment you could wish for, so there's barely a need to leave to hotel! (well, we did leave the hotel to see the sights, but you know what i mean). my wife and i particularly enjoyed the gym and spa facilities, including a relaxing massage. this hotel surpassed our expectations in every possible way, and we'll surely be staying there again the next time we visit the windy city.

"while the hotel looked absolutely lovely from the outside, my experience went downhill once i walked in. the lighting is very poor, which creates such a dark and gloomy atmosphere. the mood was accompanied by less-than-friendly staff members who made our check-in seem like nothing more than a huge hassle. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet night or a nice stay. i definitely would not stay here again.

"my stay at the hyatt regency was an experience that i'll never ever forget - not in a good way. check-in was actually pretty easy and the clerk was pleasant. i went up to my room and looked around, all seemed ok at first. i was bushed so i flopped on the bed... ohhhhh noooooo! the bed was as hard as a military bunk from my army days. but i was so tired that i just passed out. of course i woke up with a back ache...great. i figured a hot soak in the tub would help my back so i plugged the tub, turned the hot water on full force, and poured in some shower gel. i put my foot in expecting some real heat - the water was barely lukewarm. i called the front desk but they were no help, the clerk just apologized. frustrated at this point, i turned on the tv and switched on the air. i put my hand over the vent to see how cold the air was and i saw something slimy inside of the vent. it looked like a wet gray chunk of goop or something. i couldn't take anymore of this. i went down to the front desk and complained to the clerk. it seemed as though the guy was on something - he kept smiling as he apologized, no empathy as if he's used to hearing about the goop in the ac. he offered me a free night but there is no way that i'd stay at this place again - ever.

"we've just returned from a two night stay at the affinia chicago and our visit was delightful. thanks to tripadvisor reviews we were prepared for the major construction work on the facade and entrance..it was a mess. and the hotel restaurant and bar remain incomplete and unavailable. even parts of the lobby had 'wet paint' stickers. all these things could have made for a disappointing stay. not so!! although we arrived very early in the day our suite was ready along with a most warm and gracious greeting from the front desk staff. after just a few minutes we felt like we were 'at home.' the suite on the 25th floor, with a fab view along a wall of windows, was sparkling fresh and clean. the bathroom lighting was outstanding and led to my bride of nearly 50 years saying that it made her look younger...she was right! everything in and about the room was 'like-new' and very stylish. as a visitor we appreciated the very convenient location just a few steps from the magnificient mile and all of its ambiance. thanks to a dedicated and gracious staff, a fantastic location, and chic decorating elements, this hotel can and will be our future hotel of choice in chicago. the stay was short..but sweet.

"when you're standing in a craptastic excuse for a shower buttnaked and cold with soap in your hair because the water from the shower head has gone from a weak spray to a dribble to nothing coming out at all, nothing in the world will ever convince you to stay here again. the worst part is that the hotel knows this is a problem (they told me that it happens to the upper floors, and i wasn't even staying on the highest floor!) as if that makes it ok. i can look past the 'rustic' decor of the room and take it for what it is - an inexpensive place to crash, but c'mon, a girl's gotta shower.

"my friend and i visited amalfi hotel last week when we were in chicago and found it to be a great place, very sophisticated and luxurious, with lots of attention to detail in the decor and wonderful customer service. the beds were comfortable. the room service was great as was the gym... i fully enjoyed the views from the hotel room... so beautiful at night... the city scape. and in the morning, the free continental breakfast was delicious. it was a wonderful experience being at the amalfi hotel in chicago. i am eager to visit there again.

"my family and i have just had a two week holiday in chicago, and we stayed for a week at the hilton towers. we had a fantastic time and enjoyed every minute of our stay at this incredible hotel. the sheer size of the place is breathtaking and the atmosphere is very friendly and hospitable. if you prefer discreet modern boutiquey-type hotels, maybe this wouldn't be your thing. however if you enjoy old style glamour and glitz, you will be bowled over by this hotel. the place literally sparkles thanks to the enormous chandeliers that are everywhere in the lobby. tons of celebs have stayed here over the decades and the history of the hotel and past guests etc is fascinating. we got a very reasonable rate for our stay and could not fault anything about this very special place!

"' barely average hotel at premium price' this hotel has a beautiful lobby but fails to fails to maintain its standards beyond the lobby. i have stayed in the conrad in dublin, ireland and in hongkong both of which i loved. i was looking forward to staying at this hotel. i was extremely disappointed. i am very surprised that this hotel is allowed to carry the conrad name. pros: elegant lobby nicely decorated with fresh flowers location: located in the heart of chicago disappointments - stained and worn out carpet in hallway - room was small - phone and lightbulb in room were broken - breakfast was $60 for two people, service was slow and impolite - hotel rationed soaps and shampoo, one bar of soap to share and one bottle of shampoo which was not replaced for two days, i felt like i was staying at a budget hotel. and to cap off my stay the hotel made a billing error which took three months and more effort than it was worth to correct. i would not stay at this hotel again, it just is not worth the premium price they charge.

"i had the misfortune of being booked at the amalfi hotel in chicago a few weeks ago. what a joke. to start off, the housekeeping staff must be on strike or they are very understaffed. i don't know who made the bed up in my room, but it could have been done better by my 7 year old. ditto the bathroom. water spots, soap scum and (ugh) hair of all kinds in the sink, tub and about the floor. gross. i requested non-smoking, either they didn't listen or didn't care, but my room and the linens smelled like an old ashtray. the 'beautiful view' was ruined by water spots - not outside(which is forgiveable) but inside! and they were sticky. i stayed only one night. the holiday inn had rooms available, and they were clean. never again.

"the downtown chicago hilton was the best combination of all the things we were looking for in a hotel- perfect location for both those of us who like shopping and those of us who prefer tourist attractions. staying with a hilton means the essentials are never a concern- as always, the room was clean and impeccably neat, the staff friendly and very capable. the wireless access and big flat screen tv were an added plus too! best of all, it is a pet-friendly hotel, something that is unusual in bigger city 4-diamond hotels. thanks, chicago hilton, for a great stay!

"the ambassador east hotel is a business that certainly strives to keep its customers satisfied. upon my entrance at the ambassador east, i was greeted warmly. the staff was incredibly pleasant, and the accommodations were top-knotch. the food served at the award-winning 'pump room' was to die for, and the service was fast but friendly.

"my wife and i booked a deluxe accessible room at this beautiful hotel for three nights. the wonderful photos don't do the hotel justice. it couldn't have been a more ideal stay. the room was spacious and and clean, the bathroom sparkling, with every amenity one could imagine. the bed felt like it had been just delivered. our views of downtown chicago were spectacular. on top of all of this, the hotel staff was extremely helpful. they explained the best routes to the restaurants we wanted to eat at, and they even went as far as securing us reservations for the places they knew would be busy! believe everything good that you read. if you visit chicago, stay at the conrad chicago.

"i am so glad i decided to stay at the intercontinental chicago for my first trip to the city. the staff is very attentive, i felt like i was the only person they had to take care of! the location is great, right on the magnificent mile and so close to major attractions. my suite was well appointed and very clean. i even looked behind some furniture for dust and couldn't find any. the hotel is very luxurious. the sheets and towels were very soft and the bed very comfortable. the next time i travel to chicago, i will definitely stay at the intercontinental again.

"just wanted to let everyone know if you are looking for a hotel with high rise construction next door the swissotel chicago is the one for you. my wife and i went there last year and there was just an empty lot next door, this year there is a loud construction site next door. so 8 am saturday morning you will hear the workers starting. i am sure once the summer in chicago comes around they will work all night. just think as they keep adding floors you will be able to look the workers in the eye and wave from your room that used to have a view of the navy pier. now you will get an up close and personal view of people pouring concrete. on top of it the hotel is doing construction of there own. the front of the hotel is block and lucky for us the protestors that are standing in front of the hotel were able to tell use where the new entrance was. the protestors were there because the swissotel hired a company to redo their sound system that does not hire union workers. if you ask the workers about the noise and they say we can't hear it. i am sure the swissotel does not want word getting out about this. if you insist on trying it for yourself don't pay for your room in advance they will not let you out of the room and then you are stuck.

"the location of this hotel is excellent. the hotel itself is not a 4 star like they say - in my opinion. the room decor is horrible (probably more european than i am used to) and the room is small and furnished like an old apartment. on the upside, if you want to stay in a great location, feel safe, and can put up with some aesthetic issues and can get a great deal then this will work. i prefer westin or marriott...something that you can count on.

"imo the amalfi doesnt come close to justifying the glowing comments on ta. this is basically a holiday inn. half of the rooms overlook an alley / loading dock. the hotel is not more than 6 or 7 flors high and the garbage pick up woke me up daily at 5 am. at 530, when you are just nodding off again, they begin setting up for the complimentary breakfast. this is a continental buffet on every floor next to the elevator bank. any room within 100 feet of the elevators will hear the noise. reception was a bit tacky and the 'staff' was a little rough around the edges. i didn't see a single business travellers while i was there. valet parking was expensive (usual for chicago) but was very slow. just ok. explore other options.

"my stay at the homewood suites in downtown chicago was without a doubt one of the worst hotel experiences in my live. i was there for a week long conference. although my reservations had been made months in advance, they did not have a suite for me when i arrived, resulting in having to stay in another hotel for the first night. once my room was ready, i was disappointed by the cleanliness and the limitation of the kitchen: barely large enough to move around, and very few utensils to cook with. the pool was only open for limited hours, and i should not have bothered bringing a swimsuit. at night i was kept awake by the noise coming from adjacent rooms and the traffic outside. my overall experience was a stay in an overpriced suite. i will not book here ever again.

"the only minus for this hotel is they do not provide the free morning coffee at all the other kimpton hotels. it was a great place to stay for the theater but our rate did say morning coffee. the robes were not in the room and it took a long time (hours) but other than that a great place. the concierge was excellent.

"we also just returned from a frigid weekend in chicago. i booked the ambassador east because of its great rate, $89.00 with my aaa card and we were delighted. yes, the rooms show some signs of wear, but the warmth and charm far make up for it. this was such a pleasant change from the sleek, modern look of many other chain and boutique hotels. we became members of the i preferred program and were therefore eligible for an upgrade which we automatically got upon check in. we had a lovely suite with lots of sitting room and a comfortable bedroom and bathroom. we had wonderful food at the pump room which is classic. our oatmeal there was so tastefully served, i'd love to have some right now! the location was great. had it been normal winter weather, we could have easily walked to michigan avenue for shopping, but due to the minus 20 degree windchills, we opted for a cab which was less than a $5.00 fare. we also enjoyed a glass of wine around the fireplace in the lobby and found it so welcoming and cozy and not overcrowed at all. we would definitely stay here again!

"first, several day s prior to my stay, i called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for room-service saturday and sunday. saturday they didn't bring breakfast - and when i called room-service they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge. when they finally did bring it - they brought the wrong thing.. and then brought the wrong order again on sunday. i was further inconvenienced by in-room dining staff when we ordered room service saturday night. the food was limp and uninspired. further, i ordered soup - which arrived without a spoon. when i called in-room dining to request a spoon, i was told one would be forthcoming. 15 minutes later, a waiter arrived with a menu. when i explained i already had food and i didn't need a menu - i needed a spoon, he had the audacity to argue with me. i respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so. another 15 minutes (and one bowl of cold soup) later i decided to call in-room dining back to request (again) they send someone with a spoon. they too argued with me and expressed that they'd already sent someone with a spoon. i explained that they had not - that i had received a menu i didn't request, but that no spoon was forthcoming. another 15 minutes later, a spoon finally arrived. thanks - for charging me $100+ so that i could argue over cold, flavorless food. in addition to the gross customer service, surly attitude, and sorry food, i found the room woefully lacking. it reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on saturday night i woke up from the smell. further, i had specifically requested when i booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators... i was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went.

"advertised as a luxury hotel the conrad chicago is more gouge than grand. my wife and i decided to splurge on a fabulously decadent weekend in chicago for our tenth anniversary. after looking at several hotels in the 'magnificent mile' territory of downtown chicago we selected the conrad. the conrad's website impressed us immediately. the pictures of the rooms were lovely, they promised what was supposed to be a world class spa and several amenities such as huge flat screen televisions, not that we were planning to watch much tv. we called to make reservations and after navigating a ridiculous automated phone system, i was greeted by a rather irritated sounding young woman who couldn't figure out how i was unable to make my reservations via the automated system. in any case i picked the deluxe king-size bed room for two nights in mid september. my wife oohed and aaahed over the picture of the room online, most impressed with the view. it cost a pretty penny, more than i would normally spend on out of town accomidations, but her happiness was worth it. unfortunately her happiness was short lived after arrival at the conrad. valet parking was a breeze but they accidentally grabbed my wife's purse when unloading the luggage. we spent an hour in panic before a bellhop finally located it. at the front desk they were pleasant but adamant that we had reserved a room with two double beds via the automated phone system. i explained the error to the woman at the counter who was able to get us into a king-sized room but at an additional cost. by the time we arrived at our room we were a bit haggard but still looking forward to our stay. that ended when we found out that our 'view' was of a back alley service corridor. so much for the skyline. overall, the room was clean and lovely though housekeeping seemed unduly slow. i hate to be picky but i was drip dried way before my extra towels were sent up. the spa had very limited hours as well. somehow amidst it all we managed to have the anniversary of our dreams, away from the hotel. it was far from luxury service even if the sheets were of an extravagant thread count. i would not recommend the conrad chicago. i would absolutely save my money next time to spend on activities and sightseeing in chicago. i was expecting outstanding hospitality and found it no better than a mid-range priced hotel which would also have had clean rooms, but wouldn't have cleaned out so much of my wallet.

"stayed with a group for a bachelorette party, and was disappointed. the hotel is beautiful, the staff was all rather friendly. the main problem was the room/sleeping situation. we had booked rooms with 2 queen beds several weeks before, but received an email a few days before our visit stating they were sold out (how that happens i don't know!!) so they 'upgraded' us to two 'suites' with a king and a pull out. first, this meant our party was split up and on different floors. second, that meant two of us were stuck on a pull out couch. :( i'm not a picky, unreasonable person, but that was the worst 'bed' i've ever slept on! it was sunken in the middle so we literally rolled into each other unless we balanced ourselves on the very edge of the bed. then there were the springs poking into our backs all night! just awful! for the amount of money we spent i expected to be comfortable! i would not stay here again after this experience.

"we stayed at the ae for two nights for a three generation 'girls weekend' (grandma, mom and daughter). i looked at their website for an idea of rates and looked at any packages that might interest us. then i called the property directly and was assisted by a very gracious man named reece. rates were a bit high for the saturday night portion of our stay but when i requested the american girl package, he was more than happy to honor the advertised rate. the american girl package was perfect for us. my 8 year old daughter was thrilled. they give you a doll bed, a backpack and a travel kit to keep. they have matching bathrobes for girl and doll (you don't get to keep those). she also got a special welcome letter and a complimentary room service snack from a specially printed menu. our room, 1334, was large and clean. it had two double beds with nice linens, two chairs, a desk and a clean bathroom. the employees are all very friendly and helpful. we had a drink in the pump room but did not eat there. we ate breakfast nearby at a great place called the 3rd coast. this hotel is north of michigan ave. but it is just a short, pleasant walk to the mag. mile. i would definately stay here again in chicago.

"i was consistently disappointed throughout my stay at the james. i had heard from others that it was 'agreeable' and 'workable' and 'all right,' or even 'a nice place.' i figured that there would be no problems and booked a guestroom for a long weekend visit with my long-distance girlfriend. according to the website, i was about to immerse myself and my date in a bath of cutting-edge contemporary furnishings and 'warm tones.' well, when i arrived, i felt like i was in an ikea showroom just before closing time on a busy day. everything in the front was just a bit too askew. the staff were busy, distracted, inattentive, and in every way keen to show me i was a bother to them. i handled my own bags far too much to be convinced of their commitment to my comfort. i also thought my room was quite pathetic for its price. it looked distinctly like someone had rolled around on the beds just before i got there. the bathroom fixtures felt a little bit gross and smelled very strongly, inexplicably, of men's cologne. nobody cared when i complained of this and suggested that maybe it was just 'stuck in my nose' and that it would go away. well, it didn't, and i had a horrible headache by the time my lady arrived. this ruined my entire first evening in chicago. for my price i could have stayed a week at an economy hotel, gotten my personal items treated for bedbugs, and still saved money. and i would not have been treated like such a pest. needless to say, i will be looking elsewhere when i go back to chicago. i may not be a frequent patron of luxury hotels, but i know when i am wasting my money.

"a recent stay at the james hotel-chicago, revealed the the recent updating at this hotel was a facelift only. although the rooms and public areas look nice, the hotel still needs serious work. our first room was not clean when we arrived and this non-smoking room had a serious odor of cigarette smoke. we asked for a new room which was clean and odor free. we had to involve the manager before our request was granted. the new room was better at first glance, but was severely lacking. we could not get the temperature properly regulated. the room was always either too hot or too cold for our two night stay. in a hotel commanding the rates of the james, we expect the room temperature to be a comfort which is taken for granted, not something which is a constant battle. our mattress was horribly uncomfortable. when the rooms were updated, the james skipped new mattresses. ours was worn to the point of having indentations you can't get out of--when you lie down, you sort of sink into a hole. this matter of basic comfort should not be an issue in a 'luxury' hotel. last, but not least, we found the hotel to be loud at almost all times during our stay. in spite of the calming decor, the noise level was raucous and not at all conducive to a good night's sleep. all in all, we were unhappy with our accommodations at the james chicago and would recommend you avoid the hotel even though it is in a convenient location. you will be happier almost anywhere else.

"i was recently a guest at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers and was immensely dissatisfied. i arrived to find that they had 'lost' my reservation. they told me they were booked solid even though i had produced my copy of the reservation confirmation. after nearly an hour of arguing with the front desk clerk she finally asked for the hotel manager to step in. he was almost helpful. he searched the database and found that there was a 'cancellation'; however, it was not for the type of room i had reserved. i had asked for a suite as i was going to be staying in the hotel for several days. i was given a box with a bed in it. they made no apologies for losing my reservation and offered no alternate compensation. unfortunately, i was in town for a conference and everyone in the area was completely booked. i had no choice but to accept what they had offered. i begrudgingly accepted this with the intention of contacting the corporate office and posting my review here. do not stay in this hotel they will not help you with anything, even if it was their error.

"whilst no doubt being in a good location this hotel falls short in other areas. most notably is cleanliness, as although the lobby was very clean, the corridors of my floor as well as the room was not. dust lined the carpeted floor for the hallways, and in the room the the bed emitted an unpleasant odor as if the sheets had not been changed in some time. the furnishings were nice and modern, but with various blemishes upon close inspection. bathroom was relatively clean, with the exception of the shower. view was nice for this particular room, and service was relatively quick. the food in the restaurant was average but again cleanliness was an issue. this time with the glasses which were stained, the waiter promptly apologized and returned with new glasses but this is still inexcusable in what is advertised as a high class hotel. i will not make the mistake of staying here again.

"guys trip to chicago, scored this hotel on priceline for $100 a night. had a little confusion over the bed situation at first. they said they only had kings available even after i had called and requested 2 doubles. after a 30 minute ordeal at the front desk they put us in a room with 2 doubles. the room was nice, nothing specacular, a little on the small side but nice. the lobby was beautiful to look at but that's about it. hotel is within walking distance to soldier field, sears tower, espn zone, and lots of bars and restaurants. great location that and the price we got the room for made our trip. would definately try and stay at this hotel again.

"the homewood suites by hilton, in downtown chicago, has to be one of the most comfortable and affordable hotels in the windy city. after asking the doorman, i discovered all guest suites in the entire establishment feature a two room layout with a fully equipped kitchen. the full sized refrigerator caused me to do a double take, as did the stove and lcd televisions. this is definitely the place to have a home away from home while in chicago. it's mind blowing that a hotel this extravagant can have rates as low as $40 a night, which is what i payed when i stayed there in september. the atmosphere was warm and cozy, and the staff were all very friendly and professional.

"the talbott hotel is fantastic! i stayed there on business and found that it met my every need. the high speed internet access worked flawlessly; allowed me to do much of my work from the comfort of my luxuriously appointed room. i really like to exercise before a day of meetings; access to the fitness club next door was very convenient. last point: i work for a green consulting firm out of l.a. and the hotel's environmental credentials dovetailed perfectly with our mission. guilt free luxury!

"i had such high hopes when i booked a stay at the knickerbocker hotel in chicago a few short weeks ago. when i arrived i should have known things would not be as i expected them to be. the host at the desk was rude and seemed put out that i was there. when i finally got checked in and arrived in my room i found that the temperature in the room was far too hot. the air conditioner was not turned on and on a hot, muggy day it would have been nice to enter into a cool room. i turned on the air conditioner and after quite some time the room cooled down. since i arrived in the early afternoon i decided to order room service from the nix restaurant that is in the hotel, i ordered the gooey triple decker grilled cheese, at $14 i was expecting the best grilled cheese sandwich i had ever eaten. when it finally arrived, more than an hour later, it was cold and the cheese was far from gooey! it also comes with a bowl of tomato bisque soup which, needless to say was also cold. for the quality of the food, $14 was way too much to pay for this meal. after a meeting with clients we stopped by the martini bar for drinks. the waitress was rude and seemed to be overwhelmed by the amount of people she had to serve. needless to say it took forever to get our drinks. we heard other patrons grumbling about the amount of time it took for the drinks to arrive as well. finally we got our drinks, we all ordered a french martini. we all took a drink and immediately all our mouths puckered, it had far too much pineapple juice in it making it very, very tart. at $14 each you would think it would be made to perfection, far from it. the evening finally over i went back to my room where i now found the temperature to be too cold due to the air conditioner not turning itself off when it should have. after a miserable night i checked out glad to be done with the knickerbocker hotel!

"the ambassador east is located in the gold coast neighborhood of chicago. it is just a few blocks from the train station, so it was easy to get anywhere in town. the hotel is a national historic landmark so the lobby is elegant and beautiful. we loved the pump room bar with tons of b & w photos of celebrities. the service was wonderful and everyone was friendly and helpful.

" we just returned from a relaxing stay at the intercontinental in chicago. i have to say the service was phenomenal! from the maid to the concierge and everyone in between, the staff treated us like royalty. it was quite the treat to feel so special. our room was gorgeous. the view of the city was breathtaking. the luxury mattress and bedding made for the most comfortable peaceful slumber. we found the marble bathroom stunning and impeccably clean. my wife was very pleased with the lighted make-up mirror while i enjoyed the reliable wi-fi connection. during our stay we dinned in the zest. wow! they offer an extensive wine menu and a full array of gourmet food options. we had to try the famous wiener schnitzel -- it was scrumptious. afterwards, my wife and i shared the chocolate lava cake, can i just say oh that cake is to die for! really the best we ever had. in the morning we spent some time working off dinner at the junior olympic swimming pool; followed by an exhilarating round of cardio in the hotels dedicated cardio room. afterwards, a trip to the sauna was a well deserved refuge. overall, our stay at the intercontinental in chicago was nothing short of fabulous. this luxury hotel is complete with the finest of amenities and the most caring staff. we are looking forward to staying at the intercontinental again, hopeful soon!

"couldn't have asked for a better home base for checking out downtown chicago. hotel sofitel is right in the heart of the action, allowing my friends and i to hit the clubs and enjoy the local cuisine downtown's famous for. the room was comfy, with two queen mattresses, down stuffed duvets and chic decor. the bar downstairs was a bit pricey, but made up for it by being comfortable, sleek, and staffed with attentive bartenders who made excellent cocktails. one night we didn't feel like going out so we headed downstairs to eat at the cafe des architectes, which had an amazing array of choices, mostly of the french persuasion. i would definitely book here again!

"this place had character i'll give it that. but it wasn't really my style. arrived late in the evening. the first room they gave me the tv didn't work. maintenance took a look at it, and couldn't figure it out. told me i'd have to wait until the morning for the electrician. he then passed some gas and left. real professional. i phoned the front desk on account of the tv, and was able to get another room the second room was much like the first. horrible striped wall paper, dingy, and old worn carpet. bathroom was incredibly small. hard to use the toliet without banging into the door, or the sink. very cramped. the beds weren't very comfortable either. room temp hard to regulate and the ac somewhat noisy. location seem very convenient. i was there for a training session about 8 blocks away. but all of the theatres seemed to be near by, if thats what you were there for this place may be tolerable for a night or two. and don't make a long distance phone call from your room without a calling card. it was about $2/minute. i knew it would be expensive but wasn't expecting that type of rate.

"our room was on the third floor so there was some street noise - but it certainly didn't spoil our 4 nights in this lovely hotel. wine tasting evening went down extremely well after a day seeing the sights of the city!! our goldish was called oliver - nobody could believe we had our very own goldfish in our room!! all the staff were really helpful and welcoming, making our stay here very relaxing and comfortable. would certainly recommend this hotel.

"as a former chicagoan, i'm appalled at the amalfi hotel chicago. first of all, i was expecting luxury and hospitality, neither of which i received. there's an experience designer who is supposed to be like a 'personal concierge,' but my experience with my ed was terrible. i felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than i wanted to. not only that, but i couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast. when i finally got to my room, i was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the room's cleanliness. i had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp. on top of that, the bed was messily done; i could have done a better job on my own bed at home. i was angry at this point, because i was paying a lot of money for every night i was staying at amalfi, and i didn't expect to be greeted with wet towels. i needed to use the wi-fi to download some important documents, and the internet was surprisingly slow. even a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better, maybe even faster internet access. when i finally checked out of the amalfi, i made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems i'd had with my room and the hotel. i was glad to see the amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as i drove away!

"i never thought i'd be able to stay at a hotel and feel completely at home. i am a mother of two children, one of which has severe asthma and allergies. i have spent more time in hospital emergency rooms than my own living room for the past two and a half years. so when my sister was getting married in chicago, i was extremely anxious. the front desk associate, rosa, was wonderful. she told me that they have allergy friendly rooms. no perfumes, no harsh cleaning chemicals, no dreaded 'industry standard' feather pillows. i booked a room, but was still really worried. i shouldn't have been. ethan breathed as easily in that beautiful room as he did in our own home. maybe even a little better. they had an air purification system for our room. it smelled so fresh! while my husband took our daughter to the big bar for nachos (she never stopped talking about how 'totally cool' it was), i ordered room service for my son. the man who answered the phone was so patient and accommodating. my son has a lot of food allergies, so i was pretty much ordering off menu with specific details. that's always a little humbling, but the staff treated my order with the grace as though they did special orders all the time. i was actually able to enjoy my sister's wedding. the only problem with my stay is that it was too short. we're coming back for our first family vacation since ethan was born. thank you, hyatt regency chicago, for making this family's visit possible and positive!!

"this hotel was perfect for our girls getaway. the decor is fun & refreshing. loved the roof top bar. every staff member was friendly & always smiling. the location is perfect for michigan ave shopping, the beach, dinner and night life. it was a mile or two from millenium station. the concierge recommended a couple places to hang out after dinner and added our names to the guest list (i'm sure they do it all the time but still a nice gesture).

"we needed an extra night in chicago after a gratus stay at the penninsula and won a skyauction bid for the james @ $203. this is one of the nicest hotels that i've ever stayed in. bathroom aside, we felt it equalled the penninsula in comfort and level of service. i echo all of the superlatives previously written and would love to stay here anytime i'm in town.

"the reviews we read were a bit mixed, but i thought it was excellent. i've stayed in the splendido, villa d'este and others and it doesn't compare, but nor should it. it doesn't claim to be in that space. i expected it to be a notch off the four seasons and so it proved. a only a small notch too!. lovely clean and bright room. superb views, very quiet, comfy bed etc. excellent service all round and nice staff. for the money and quality it stacked up very well indeed. couldn't really fault it any way given it was half the cost of the four seasons but pretty close in terms of overall experience. we will go there again when in chicago. great location too.

"we recently completed our first visit to chicago and were pleasantly surprised by the affinia chicago hotel where we stayed. the hotel has gone to great lengths to offer extra services to their guests, including individual pillow choices, complimentary kits with items designed to enhance the city visit,and fine dining in two on-site restaurants, one of them roof-top with amazing city views. i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting chicago.

"i had really high hopes for this hotel. the location seemed great and the prices were too. unfortunatley, you get what you pay for. despite being located near the miracle mile and navy pier, there weren't many other redeeming qualities. the staff was very rude. we arrived late after a long drive from detroit and found nobody in the lobby to help us check in. once we finally got checked in, our room hadn't been cleaned and there was trash left over from the last people. we were told the cleaning staff had gone home for the night and they couldn't get to it until morning! we had planned on seeing some of chicago's attractions like the field museum but we could hardly find anyone to help us out with where to go. their website advertises lots of specials and packages but we found absolutely no way to purchase them. finally, when we checked out, they had charged our room an extra cleaning fee because the cleaning we requested on the first night. ridiculous!

"my husband and i stayed at the hotel allegro chicago to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary this past weekend. the hotel is the perfect combination of sophistication and glamour from the moment you arrive. the concierge staff was very friendly and accommodating throughout our weekend stay, and the hotel itself provided many interesting and fun things to do. we were very impressed with the overall setup of the hotel; the lobby, dining areas, and rooms all had a special touch of class that made our weekend exciting and full of luxury. the decor of our room was very modern and eclectic with hues of blue and white, and lighting that complimented and set the mood. the bar and lounge areas had excellent service, and the views from our room perfectly captured the excitement of downtown chicago. additionally, my husband and i were extra pleased to learn that because we are aaa members, we would be receiving 20% off our room rate for the weekend. overall, the amenities and experience of staying at the hotel allegro chicago made us feel like movie stars, pampered and taken care of all weekend in a classy establishment, one in which we would definitely choose to stay again.

"last month, my husband and i stayed at the intercontinental chicago while we were in town for imts. although they were very busy, the service was excellent and very professional. the staff were always smiling and happy to help. intercontinental was conveniently located near michigan avenue, and the best stores and restaurants in town. the view from our room was great! our room was always clean when we arrived home at night, it was decorated nicely, and the beds were extremely comfortable! we ate at the hotel's restaurant zest, and the food was great! it was by far one of the best hotels we have visited in a while. we will definitely be back!

"simply a nice place to stay... i had a great deal for the room, and was impressed with the quality. hotel staff was very helpful; they were able to let me check out and helped me print boarding passes. negative: it is frustrating that nowadays you do not have free internet in most hotels and it's the same here; you have to pay for the internet. negative: loud on the phone you may hear your neighbors on the phone, or them shower.

"first let me say, i try not to be too critical, but in some cases the truth is warranted! we checked in and things seemed fine. location was excellent. woke up the first morning, to a slightly rumpled bed covered in 'stains', i hope-filthy and not 4 star hotel quality. requested a linen change and heard a knock on the door- a gentleman was there to let me know if i wanted it done to take off the privacy sign, i did and no one even came until later in the day. the room was big enough, had no drawers, suposedly remodeled but carpet didn't reach the wall, toilet paper holder fell off constantly and shower head was broken. the mirrors were great and the water was always hot! the walls were paper thin, i heard every conversation the guests next door had. they were not noisy but you could hear everything including the t.v. through the walls and vents. internet was $13.00, worked for a bit and then not again, i called customer service and spent 25 minutes on the phone and they asked if they could work on resetting the system and call back later. the hotel did give us a credit for the charges. at this point, enough was enough, we packed our bags and checked out. the front desk was very helpful- kudos to rocco for caring and being the only friendly staff we saw other than the bell hops!!

"the hotel monaco claims to be a 'boutique chicago luxury hotel,' but it certainly was neither luxurious nor stylish. the pictures posted on the website imply that the guest is going to stay in a room with an amazing view, but that was certainly not the case for this customer! the decor, which might be 'cutesy' or 'charming' to some was actually quite tacky and outdated. the bathrooms had a musty smell and did not meet the cleanliness standards of a hotel claiming to be 'one of the top 40 hotels u.s.' don't be fooled by a snappy website with some selective photos--this hotel does not live up to its billing. you will be disappointed, as was i, if you expect anything more than a run-of-the-mill experience at a merely average hotel.

"my wife and i were excited to visit and shop at chicago's magnificent mile on michigan ave. we chose the intercontinental hotel for it's reputation and location. man oh man, were we disappointed. the check in was smooth enough even though the hotel was busy and all seemed well. we got ready to go out shopping and went to visit the concierge in the lobby to ask about suggestions and bargains. there were six people in line for her and we had to wait. that was no problem since we weren't on a timetable. when we finally got to her and asked about shopping on the miracle mile, she just pointed to the door and said, 'it's right out the door.' i asked her for suggestions of the best stores for bargains and she rolled her eyes at me saying, 'there's no such thing.' i couldn't believe her abruptness. we left the concierge stand not wanting to return. shopping went well and was fun. we returned to our room and wanted to look up a restaurant for the night ourselves rather than ask the concierge. we couldn't find a hotel directory in the room. i called the housekeeping department and was told, 'we're all out of directories here in the office.' i asked if they could check a vacant room for one. she said the hotel was full and there were no vacant rooms. i hung up and thought i would just look for a restaurant in the yellow pages. guess what? you guessed it, no phone book in the room. i figured we could go get a drink at the bar, the hotel's 20's themed lounge, and ask the bartender for suggestions. we went to the bar and there were only three other customers. we sat at the bar and got our drinks. as i was about to ask the bartender for restaurant suggestions, his cell phone rang. he answered it and went to the other end of the bar to talk. twenty minutes later, he was still on the phone. tired and hungry, my wife and i went back to our room and ordered a pizza to be delivered from pizza hut. although the hotel is nice enough and the furnishings comfortable, the indifference of the staff will keep me from ever coming back. a big thumbs down to the intercontinental chicago. they need to look up the word hospitality in the dictionary.

"the swissotel is totally understaffed and lacking any charm or atmosphere. it was clean, comfortable and had great views but if you wanted to check-in, use the concierge, check-out, or report a problem to the front desk, forget about it. i booked this place through priceline.com so i can't complain too much as i didn't pay a lot for the room but i have stayed at 4 star hotels in the past as well as another swissotel. it left a lot to be desired. the minibar fridge in my room didn't work so forget about a cold beer. also, the internet/movie/guest services console didn't work so i had to go to the business office to access the internet. when it was time to checkout the console still wasn't working. it's better than the holiday inn but way below expectations for a 4 star hotel

"the omni chicago hotel is not pretty as they advertise it. first of all, it really difficult to get there because its located in down town chicago and they fail to mention that the traffic is a nightmare. if you finally make to the hotel you have to wait like 30 minutes for the front desk to take care of you. when i arrived there was one person at the desk and a few people checking in, and i thought the wait time was ridiculous. to make matters worse, i need internet connection and the day i was there they had technical problems and the internet was not working in my room. two hours later they managed it get to work, the connection was still very slow. for my part, the hotel might look nice but services is did not meet my expectations. i was disappointed and will never stay there again, if i go back to chicago. if was rating it, i would give it 1/2 star out of 5.

"my experience with the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel was terrible! i arrived exactly at my check in time only to be told my room would not be ready for another hour. i chose to wait patiently at the hotel bar and found myself again disappointed i sat for 15 minutes before the bar tender served me and the drink i received was warm. when the room was finally ready i was horrified to find hairs in the bathtub and mysterious spots on the bedding. when i called down to housekeeping the staff was very rude and maid who they sent up to change my sheets acted annoyed and muttered under her breath the whole time she was changing our sheets and cleaning the bathroom. after all this hassle i would normally expect at least a complimentary beverage but not only was that not offered i found even using internet at this location involved a rather exorbitant fee 13.95 for a 24 hour period. i was shocked having stayed at a variety of higher end hotels i have never once been asked to pay extra for my wifi access. overall i was highly disappointed with my stay and will not be returning to the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel any time soon.

"i was really expecting a lot more from a quality chain like the sheraton, but a recent stay at their downtown location in chicago was somewhat of a disappointment. it started with check in; i had specifically requested a room with a single king-size bed, but was told at the front desk in no uncertain terms (ok, rather rudely!) that because of some banker's convention that was going on, i should be happy with the double-bed room that was left. it was all i could do to get a lousy drink voucher for my inconvenience! the room itself was ok, nothing special though. the cleaning staff must've just been through, because there was a faint aroma of old washrags still in the air. the internet jack wasn't working. it took more than two hours for a maintenance guy to come up to fix it, no apologies given. for the price, i really expected more in the way of customer service from sheraton. i guess they're really no better than anyone else these days!
