"complete disappointment. problems: 1. the alarm clock/stereo thing was broken in my room. it was constantly emitting low, changing hissing noises. sooo annoying. and there was no off switch on the damn thing. i had to move the bed to unplug it (the outlet was wayyy back, buried behind the big bed). i kept hearing it, and didn't realize what it was, until it had kept me awake for a few hours. 2. the shower was only incredibly hot. turn it all the way cold...very hot. turn it to hot, and you get boiling hot. grrrrreat. so how do i get water that won't scald me? this is very inconvenient early in the morning when you need a shower and are in a hurry, and have to dance into and out of painfully hot water. good job omni! 3. hallway carpets are disgusting and old. walking around, you'd think you're in a motel 6. and my floor had been flooded or something, and they had box fans running in the hallway, 24/7, to try to dry it out. talk about an overpriced dump.

"my friend and i stayed for just one night, and loved the hotel. it had an awesome water feature in the hotel, and great large bar. like all hyatts it had a very comfortable bed, lot's of pillows, and large bathroom.

"chicago has many wonderful luxury hotels for tourists and business travelers. when visiting the windy city, however, the conrad hotel and resort is one to avoid. while the description promises clean accommodations, luxury amenities, and 'deep soaking tubs,' in relity, the rooms fall short of expectations. i opened the door to my suite to find a musty smell in the room similar to that of an old neglected closet. a bit disappointed, i decided to ignore this fact. hoping to take a nice long soak after my travels, i made my way to the bathroom. while i did find a large, deep bathtub, there was a hard water stain giving it a dingy look. hardly what i expected for the price i paid for the accommodations. in the corner of the bathroom, i found a reminder of a pevious guest, a clump of blond hair. the maid service seemed to be lacking. not to be deterred from enjoying my stay, i decided to watch television on the 42 inch flat screen i had been promised. unfortunately, the battery to the remote control was dead. i called the front desk, at my wits' end, to complain about the issues, but was greeted by a desk clerk with a very sassy attitude who seemed to doubt my every word. overall, i would definitely not recommend the conrad hotel and resort in chicago. my room was dirty, the staff was unfriendly, and the ammenities were few and far between. on my next stay in chicago, i will definitely stay elsewhere.

"i booked my room at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers somewhat reluctantly; i was not enthusiastic about spending over $200 on this room after seeing the lackluster photos on their website. i was pleasantly surprised when i arrived that the lobby did not look as stuffy as it did online. unfortunately, my hopes were dashed once again when i arrived at my room. i say 'at' because after discovering my newly issued key was not working, i had to wait ten minutes before someone finally came to let me in. the room was painfully small-- if i didn't know better i would have thought i was staying at a red roof inn! the 'sweet sleeper bed' had stiff and scratchy sheets, with a cheap-motel-thin coverlet. the disappointment continued after i entered the bathroom and found that it not only reeked of smoke, but also outfitted with the cheapest trimmings possible. i stayed my two nights, and was surprised to find out that all sorts of other charges were added to my room (for which i was not responsible), charged on demand movies, an empty mini bar, and for smoking in the bathroom. hah! i have stopped payment on my credit card, and most certainly will not be submitting myself to this horrific experience again.

"affinia hotel in chicago was one of the most interesting hotels i have ever stayed in. everything looks very nice and fancy, though the people that work there must be from the projects of chicago. the customer service was the worst i have ever experienced in my life! when we went to check in, first we had to wait about 15 minutes for the 3 workers that were at the desk to stop their personal conversation and check us in. when the women at the counter finally acknowledged us, she was smacking her gum, and was upset and treating us like we were inconveniencing her! the room service brought us cold eggs for breakfast, and the attitude of the staff overall was extremely rude. i would never go back, and i hope this place gets a staff makeover if they want to stay in business.

"i believe i can not describe how amazing was our stay at the james. service was impecable, from the door man to the front desk. location could not be better. yes, you can hear the ambulances in the street from the 14th floor, but, come on, you are downtown, what do you expect....overall noise was not in a level to bother us. the only minor incident was a cleaner that tried to open our room to clean at 9 pm...pm not am? go figure...

"my husband and i wanted to spend the weekend in chicago to celebrate our anniversary, and i had been looking at the james for awhile because it was attached to david burke's primehouse. from the moment i called to make my reservation, i knew this hotel understood what customer service means to a consumer and a picky one at that. from the pre-arrival dossier, to the special sweets from the staff to kick off our anniversary weekend and a hand written note thanking us for staying at the james, this staff is well versed in the long lost art of customer service. the rooms were well appointed and the beds comfy and warm on a cool weekend. the walking distance to michigan av is a huge plus. from the front desk to the cleaning staff, the staff here is top notch! and david burke's primehouse is not to be missed!

"my three night stay at fairmont chicago millennium park was the perfect way to end a weekend. the hotel has a classy but warm atmosphere with color tones that please the mind and soothe the eyes. the staff was ready to help at any notice and always greeted you with a cheerful smile. the myspa was the getaway of a life time. my only complaint would be that the bed covers were a bit too stiff as they were new and clean but the softness of the bed whisked me away to a deep slumber in no time. well worth the money and i know my next stay will be much longer.

"my husband and i were in the fairmont chicago recently for a conference. we stayed in a spacious suite. all amenities appeared recently updated and in excellent shape. the bed was very comfortable. views were great. i love their products in the bathroom and used them in the pristine tub two out of three nights. the room was so quiet, it was very relaxing. we ate in the restaurant downstairs (aria) and although pricey, it was excellent. the staff were consistently attentive and responsive. it is evident that everyone is very well-trained. i would love to stay here again.

"if you are ever going to visit chicago and need a place to stay i recommend this hotel. this hotel made my stay in chicago one that i will always remember. the rooms were very big and luxurious, everybody was friendly and showed a fabulous display of customer service. the room service always got there when they said it would and it was nice because it was 24 hours so i could get anything whenever i wanted. the price of this hotel for my stay was unbeatable especially because i got great service and i saved a lot compared to the rates of other hotels in the area and their two restaurants were exquisite. if you are ever going to be in the chicago area and need a hotel to stay in i recommend this hotel!

"recently stayed at the intercontinental chicago magnificent mile and was a little underwhelmed. it's convenient location did not compensate for the fact that the property is very old and definitely in need of some updating and renovating. there is a definite need for some noise control -- everything and everybody could be heard from inside the room. hearing the plumbing from other guests' rooms was particularly annoying. the fitness facilities are really hyped but unfortunately they were not free to use (at least it wasn't included with my booking choice). parking was pretty expensive so if you really don't need it, don't use it. overall, just dissappointed that the great location wasn't matched with great accommodations.

"after reading all the lukewarm reviews for this hotel, i went ahead and got an ambassador membership just to hedge off any unpleasantness. i normally have a good experience with intercontinental hotels, particularly the mark hopkins in sf. i called the hotel directly to confirm that my reservation was designated as ambassador club. when i arrived at the hotel, there was no separate check-in line (as advertised) and the manager on duty basically ignored me when i told him i was an ambassador club member and stuck me with a regular tiny room. i was nearly half an hour checking in the room and had to deal with the arrogant attitude of the manager on duty. they gave me a room in the 'modern' tower, (built in the 60's) which was about 2/3 the size of a regular room at the mark hopkins (built in '29). i had to deal with torn sheets, cracked marble sinks, and the spare roll of toilet paper being located outside the bathroom inside the closet - how convenient is that? the closet door, if you are not careful, may break the full length mirror attached to the bathroom door. i was not provided with a key to the minibar and i called for turndown service, which never happened. the next day, they finally got around to the fact that i was an ambassador club member and entitled to an upgraded room, but since i travel with a medical device which i already set up in the tiny room, i declined. to their credit, they did send some of the amenities i would otherwise be entitled to as an ambassador club member. i would not stay at this hotel next time i go to chicago. there are other better places for the money including, the omni, the james, the fairmont, hyatt, sheraton, monaco, crowne plaza, even the holiday inn and marriotts located in the same general area.

"last week i stayed at the hilton chicago for 4 days and 3 nights and i was very pleased with the experience. as soon as i approached the front desk, i knew right away the staff was friendly and courteous. they had given me a list of local attractions such as the museum of science and industry, the broadcast museum, the ford center for the performing arts and willis tower. i stayed in a junior suite which included a king size bed, a 27 inch television, non-allergenic feather pillows and a variety of other amenities. the indoor pool was rather large as well as the gym which includes countless treadmills and even a jogging track. eating in the area is not a problem as the hilton chicago is home to kitty o'sheas which is a restaurant offering authentic irish fare. in conclusion, i had a wonderful time staying here and i can not wait to plan my return trip to the hilton chicago.

"have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have never failed to be anything but delighted. great bar (draught stella and guinness) which was being upgraded at the end of march when i was last there, good food, lovely staff, large clean rooms, comfortable beds, spot on location for the golden mile, joey's pizzas next door are fantastic. ignore any bad reviews you read about this hotel as the authors must either have been very unlucky or impossible to please. highly recommended

"swisses chicago: nice, but lacking in some pretty basic expectations in our modern era in a great spot along the chicago waterfront. a spacious room is a comfortable respite from the city, but don't plug in your computer or hope for a free donut in the morning. no free wifi here ,or affordable breakfast, or a free swim in the pool. just a ten-dollar-a-night charge for internet, an on average $25 plate for breakfast, and another 15 bucks a night for the 'fitness center.' i've stayed in small town no star motels where wifi is free as part of a 50 dollar room. get with it - this is 2009! no free breakfast is not so bad as you probably ate too much for dinner and don't need it anyway, but for those of us who aren't charging everything to the company card some basics would be appreciated. coffee, milk, oj; stale donuts, ,muffins, maybe some cereal. throw us a little something besides fruit flavored water in the lobby. with regards to swimming, this is another one wrapped up in a fitness center fee but the pool is only open till 10 pm plan accordingly. this all makes the $6 fiji bottled water in the room seem like a bargain. summation: drop the fees, the nickel dimming of folks, and just charge what you need to charge to compliment what is otherwise a nice hotel.

"my husband and i recently stayed at the conrad chicago for three nights, a thursday through saturday. let me say we were less than pleased with our experience. we chose to stay in the 'king bed deluxe room' and for an average of over three hundred dollars a night we were sorely disappointed with the accommodations. upon entry the room looked as though it had not been cleaned thoroughly, the rug looked dirty and there were crumbs or something on the dresser. the room was size was average, and again for three hundred dollars a night we were expecting a almost suite type room. the major annoyance was how loud people were. we came in after midnight each evening and long after we went to bed we could hear people coming down the hallway yelling and running. that is totally unacceptable for a supposed high end hotel. you can expect a loud guest maybe once, but every night is ridiculous. the service was also extremely sub par. we had to wait 20 minutes at check in because the girl at the counter was too busy talking to another employee about what she was going to do after work. one day we put the no house cleaning sign on the door and a maid literally walked in on me. she completely disregarded the sign, did not even bother to knock and just unlocked the door and came right in. it scared me and i'm just glad i was not getting out of the shower or changing. so to sum up, we will never stay at the conrad again, we will never recommend it to anyone else, and for the money there are a hundred much better hotels to stay at in chicago.

"my wife and i spent several nights here on a getaway excursion. i didn't choose it -- priceline gave it to me for $70. if i'd paid the book rate, $175, i'd have been less pleased. no troubles with checkin. very small room but bed was clean and comfortable. starbucks in the lobby was a godsend. i'd read horror stories about the staff but they seemed friendly enough. for $70, it's a steal. for its online face value, not so much. will definitely return if can get similar price.

"a decent place to stay. the people are nice enough, yet the atmosphere was not what i was expecting. the rooms were not very spacious, nor welcoming. so many places to eat, yet the food was very pricey and average. i would stay here again possibly, but i feel like i could find a better option for a better price.

"not worth the price! i had the unfortunate experience of staying in the hilton homewood suites in downtown chicago. i stayed there with my family while we were on vacation. i wish i would have saved my money and went somewhere else. with a hotel this expensive, you think that they might throw in some bonuses your way, like complimentary parking. not a chance. in addition to the $259 price tag, i also had to pay $30 for parking, per night. if i had stayed at the motel 6, parking would have been free. the staff there were not very nice at all. when i registered, the lady at the counter acted like helping me was interfering with her internet chat time. she was very rude to me. perhaps she was having a bad day or something, but i doubt it. after i arrived in my room, my key card didn't work, and i had to go back downstairs to get it fixed (once again, interrupting her precious free time with some actual work). the rooms had some nice features, like kitchen appliances and a flat screen television. i didn't go on vacation to cook though. the television didn't get very many channels, and you had to pay if you wanted to watch any of their movies (of course). i tried logging into facebook to say hello to my friends from the hotel room, but the 'complimentary' internet access was so slow that it was hardly worth using. i get a better connection at starbucks. they offer a complimentary dinner and breakfast, but it's nothing to write home about. i've had better food at mcdonald's. the food was pretty cold, and the choices are very limited. traffic around the hotel was hideous. this hotel is downtown, and you can definitely tell. there are a bunch of one-way streets around, which makes getting in and out confusing. the room was pretty clean, but you can say that about a lot of hotels in a wide variety of price ranges. if you're looking for a hotel in chicago, i'd say save some money and go somewhere else. i've had better stays at the best western and many other hotels that cost less.

"i travel to chicago quite often, and have stayed at a bunch of hotels. i stayed at conrad a couple of times. my impression was not too good. both times the receptionist was quite cold and i didn't feel welcome at all. the room was noisy. thin walls, and you could hear exactly what the next room is talking about. one time the tv was broken too, and a guy came in and took like an hour to fix it... anyway, given that this is a 4.5 star hotel, it really didnt live up to my expectations. after the 1st time at this hotel, i thought i might give it a second try. after the 2nd time, i decided i am really not coming back, especially given that there are so many other hotels close by. the other attendees of our conferences were also complaining about the hotel. so i guess i am not alone in this...

"went to chicago for a week in may, decided to be good to ourselves and stay in the hilton, we were not disapointed. perhaps it was becuse there were quite a few conventions going on and a lot of people were only staying 1 or 2 nights but we got upgraged to exceutive level. we had 2 double beds with a bathroom each. they beds and pillows were too die for, so so comfy ant the end of a day when we seemed to have walked for miles. all the staff were very helpful. a lot of guests seemed to ignore the staff especially the chamber maids who they seemed to think they were in their way so perhaps that why some people felt these people were rude or unhelpful. about 2 blocks away on harrison is a cafe called 'orange' which you have to make the only place you will have breakfast, the cafe and the staff are suberb. expect a 15 min wait on a sat & sun morning.

"the amalfi hotel has become my absolute favorite place to stay when i visit chicago. this place really knows how to treat their guests. they serve a complimentary breakfast on every floor and even have ipod docking stations in the room! if you want to watch a movie you can just borrow it from their collection. i took advantage of the free wi-fi and the plush bathrobes. while i stayed there i had to try the spa services that were offered. wonderful experience! the staff really made me feel comfortable during my stay and i will definitely be staying there again on my next trip to chicago.

"after a my stay at the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago i contemplated the the poor quality of my experienc there and felt the need to document it. while the amenities were plush, the service of the staff was lacking. upon check in, my reservation was 'lost' and it took over 30 minutes for the manager to make arraingments for my stay. there was no offer to upgrade me or comp me in any way. room service did a poor job in cleaning my room and left wet towles in the bath room. a used coffee filter was left in the coffee pot for me to clean out. i am not sure my sheets were changed out. when i checked out, the bell hop dropped my laptop and destroyed my hard drive leaving me to scramble to recover the report i spent days creating. overall my negative experience has left me wondering if they train thier staff on the proper way to attend to their customers. i will be relunctant to stay with them again until i am assured they have focused on trainging their staff better.

"if i didn't have to stay here, i wouldn't. without exception, i swear i am not lying, every day of my stay brings a new problem. over the past 3 months, i have stayed here 6 times for 3 nights at a time; problems every time. from the wrong food with room service, to room keys that dont work, unrefreshed bath towels, forgotten and dirty in-room coffee service, unclean ice bucket overnight, forgotten room cleaning, inability to connect to the internet....i'm too tired to keep writing all the problems. for the price of this chi-chi downtown hotel, i expect more. finally, their team is certainly not trained in customer service. the front desk teams have attitudes, and aria's hostesses think they are something else. i'm stuck using this hotel since it is adjoined to aon, but i would never go back if i had a choice. the only good thing is the food at aria - outstanding.

"we stayed at the ritz carlton two weeks prior, and in comparison the sofitel does not come close. with the deal the ritz carlton is putting on right now, stay two nights...get one free, choose the nicer option! pros: room service: quick! 15 minutes tops. bathroom: large bathroom with a separate shower and tub. lobby: very impressive, and the doormen are on top of opening the doors and hailing a cab for you. location: close to the train station and mi ave. cons: no top sheet! we asked the others at the conference, they confirmed...there is no top sheet. you just sleep with the duvet cover over you. room: -small, and not a fan of the modern decor. -broken closet door, the bottom track was bent. by the last day my husband removed the closet door completely so i could get to my things. -barely any storage: closet was teeny tiny anyways, almost no bigger than a tall locker, only the top drawers of the nightstands open. -shower: horrible water pressure. -the cleaning staff did not replace shampoo, soap, etc. had to call the front desk, and they delivered within 10 mins. -the cleaning staff did not replace our duvet cover during the three nights we were there, realized this as i still noticed a stain we made the first night. i made sure not to leave the 'save the water' card out. they changed our towels, but not the bedding??? -our room was at the end of the hall across from where the staff enter, and you could heard that door slam shut all hours of the day. -they charge for wi-fi! -you can change the settings on the tv...brightness, etc.

"this is about the fourth time we stayed at the allegro. the previous times, i have nothing but good to say about the allegro. but my reaction has soured on this place. we have stayed here the past few years on the first weekend in december as a kick off to the holiday season and our shopping. from the very start, this year was a disappointment. i had checked the deals on a number of sites before calling the allegro. i was quoted one price (higher than what was on line), when i mentioned this, i was told i could have the lower price. at check in, the desk was nice but not friendly. we discovered that our room was not as good as in the past (punishment for asking for a lower price?) the closet had no hangers, we had no place to put our suitcase. no one mentioned the wine reception in the evening. on the second day, we discovered that even our bath mat for the shower was missing. it took two phone calls and almost two hours to get a new one. i wrote the management following our stay. i have yet to receive a reply. needless to say we will be looking elsewhere when we go into the city the next time. i would advise others to do the same.

"my experience at the ambassador east hotel was truly terrible. i went to chicago with my husband and children to attend a wedding. this hotel was recommended by the wedding party. it was a terrible choice. despite the special discount we got because of the wedding, the hotel turned out to be very expensive compared to other nearby hotels. the staff and amenities were also very unfriendly to children. my kids were absolutely terrified of several members of the staff who scowled at them and yelled at them for no reason. the place was also very formal and stiff and decorated with a lot of breakable and expensive items. my son narrowly avoided breaking a vase when an ill tempered bellhop nearly ran him down with a luggage cart. overall, i would say i was very displeased with the staff, the hotel's attitude towards children, and the expense of the hotel. on the plus side, our window had an excellent view of the city. still, i would not return here again.

"i booked two rooms four months in advance at the talbott. we were placed on the top floor next to the elevators, which are used all night long. when speaking to the front desk, i was told that they were simply honoring my request for an upper floor, which i had requested for a better view. i am looking at a brick wall, and getting no sleep. he also told me that they had received complaints before from guests on the 16th floor, and were aware of the noise problem. why then did they place us on this floor when the hotel is not totally booked? a request for an upper floor does not constitute placing someone on the top floor and using that request to justify this. if you decide to stay here, request a room on a lower floor and away from the elevator! i spoke at length when booking my two rooms about my preferences. this is simply poor treatment of a guest whom they believed would not complain.

"my wife and i stayed at the amalfi on a trip to visit our son and some friends from norway who were vacationing in the city. we were excited about staying at the amalfi after reading the reviews here, but really disappointed in the accommodations. the web site has a photo of the 18 story building that houses the hotel. it doesn't state that the hotel only occupies the first 6 floors of the building. the rest are offices. our room was on the 4th floor with a view of a blank brick wall about 16 feet distant. the room itself was unremarkable, with standard furnishings equivalent to a holiday inn. although it is close to the best part of the city, it is tucked behind the new trump tower and opens on a surprisingly sketchy stretch of road/sidewalk. our norwegian friends, by contrast, stayed on the 33rd floor of swissotel and had views of the lake and navy pier.

"we absolutely loved the knickerbocker. now, if you expect your hotels to be cookie cutter comfortable, forget this place. if holiday inns are like the rows of housing developments in the suburbs, the knickerbocker is like those beautiful old houses in the center of the city. the location is great, the hotel bar is cozy and classy, and the rooms feel like guest bedrooms in victorian mansions. for the price, you simply can't do any better than this in downtown chicago.

"my wife and i stayed at the abassador east hotel in august to attend the air and water show in chicago. i called ahead to ensure a sw view that would allow us to watch the airshow from our room if the weather did not permit us to watch from one of the nearby beaches. upon arrival at the hotel, not only was our room on the west side of the hotel it wasn't even a single king as was requested. apparently the hotel had overbooked king rooms for the event weekend and we were downgraded to a queen room. the room itself was small and underwhelming. the was not dirty, but the linens and furnishings all had a very old and worn feel. the hotel was packed the weekend we visited. the staff was obviously not prepared to cater to such a large crowd. the concierge and reception desks were continuously busy. the hotel restaurant was very slow and had long waits. the main lobby and other common areas throughout the hotel were also undergoing renovations making getting around and fighting crowds of other people even more difficult! luckly the weather was nice and the airshow was enjoyable. we will not be staying at the abassador on future trips. hopefully, current renovations will provide a much needed lift to the hotels current worn down vibe...

"i recently traveled up to chicago for business and had a terrific 3 day 2 night stay at the sofitel chicago water tower in downtown. the location was perfect as it gave me easy access to michigan avenue and the conference center where i was doing business. my hotel room was rather nice with a very comfortable king size bed and a cozy atmosphere. i ordered room service for dinner and it came within 30 minutes so i was quite pleased with that and they serve from their own restaurant which is located downstairs. the food was extremely good and i really enjoyed not having to go out and fight the traffic to find a good place to eat. i had been really tired from my meeting earlier in the day and had no trouble going to bed on the comfortable mattress. i woke up and took a shower and the bathroom was definitely up to standard with any other quality hotel. they had all the soaps and stuff as usual and they had plenty of towels on hand as well. after shower i headed down and they had a breakfast buffet at the restaurant which was free for hotel guests. the breakfast was delicious and started my day out right. after my business stuff was over i really got out and enjoyed chicago. i met up with a friend who came over and visited my hotel and she was quite impressed with it as well. when i go back to chicago i will definitely stay at the sofitel again.

"upon entering homewood suites, i was greeted by incredibly friendly staff and my breath was taken by the beauty of the hotel. when i saw my room, i was immediately relieved because it provided all of the amenities needed for my week-long business stay (refrigerator, microwave, stove, dishwasher, flat panel tv). best of all, the hotel has an on-site fitness center where i was able to work off all of the extra calories i consumed during the delicious complimentary breakfast. i couldn't resist their omelettes! the hotel is in the heart of chicago and i must say, the city view from my room was priceless. definitely recommended!

"the inter continental is a great hotel. the staff was very friendly, and the accomidations were great. the room was clean and ready on time, and the indoor swimming pool was perfect considering chicago's weather. eno was simply amazing. their wine selection is second to none. and the turkey pumpkin curry at zest was to die for.

"i stayed at the allegro in july for 4 nights for a business trip. the room was spotlessly clean and the bed was great. i had read reviews that said the bathrooms were tiny, but ours was perfectly fine, with funky, fun doors. the decor is a lot of fun. we were on the 15th floor and there was absolutely no street noise. the front desk staff was very friendly, and before we even made it to the desk, a lovely man took our bags and brought them up to our room within moments of our arrival. we were within walking distance to all the theaters and even walked one night all the way to navy pier. for people who were upset about no free coffee - there's a dunkin donuts about a block away. i definitely recommend this hotel!

"recently stayed at the james chicago and will not be returning anytime soon. the staff is unfriendly to say the least and the prices are outrageous. also not a fan of the fact they allow pets as guests. there wasn't enough space in the gym and the lack of variety in equipment limits your options severely. ultimately i was very unimpressed with the services as a whole and would recommend you avoid this establishment.

"we stayed at this hotel for a conference. the lobby and the conference areas were immaculate. the restaurants (one of which was shula's steakhouse) and bars were great. the saff was exteremely helpful. the rooms left a lot to be desired...our nonsmoking room smelled of smoke. the a/c system was ancient and tempermental, and the bathroom was old and in need of a makeover. it was surprising to see since the physical plant was so nice. we would choose, however, to stay elsewhere. espcially for the money we paid.

"we stayed in a king suite at the hotel allegro over memorial day weekend. we paid $130/night, and it was definitely a bargain. the suite was huge - living room with a couch, two chairs, desk; large bathroom; bedroom; two closets. the room had recently been renovated, and was very clean. comfortable bed, friendly staff, great location (near the train and bus), evening wine reception and morning coffee provided. while the allegro isn't a five-star hotel, it is a great place for the money. (note: a friend stayed in a non-suite room, and reported that it was very small. upgrade if possible).

"i was lucky enough to get a '4 star' hotel off of priceline for $70 - i was luckier that i got the knickerbocker! from check in to check out the hotel staff was extremely helpful and friendly. the rooms are small but cozy. after reading the reviews from other guests i was somewhat scared of what i would find - they must have stayed at a different hotel. i am a very frequent traveler and felt that the rooms and the hotel met the '4 star' rating. yes, the rooms and bathrooms were small, but what historic hotel in a big city isn't? the decor and quality met my expectations. the lobby and bar were very inviting. overall, i would stay here again and again.

"this was my first time in chicago and wanted a hotel that was in a good location. this definitely fit the bill. i could walk to all the places i wanted to see - very close to michigan ave and the magnificent mile. about a 15 minute walk to the art institute. the hotel staff was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. there was coffee in the lobby every morning, that was very welcome. the room was comfortable and clean and fairly quiet. i could hear the train and some traffic from the street (considering the location, this wasn't bad and didn't affect my ability to sleep or relax). i would definitely recommend this hotel - a gem!!

"chicago is one of our favorite cities to visit. some friends suggested trying the talbott. i'm delighted we took them up. the talbott is a great 'small' hotel a block and a half off of michigan avenue near the four seasons, drake and westin. the concierge staff was most helpfull. gene and stephanie took great care of us. the rooms were spacious and very fresh. the elevators could be a bit slow at times. aside from the construction next door, our stay was perfect. bice now runs the hotel restaurant. we enjoyed having breakfast there. we will stay there again.

"we booked our stay through priceline.com and got a great deal. we were only staying one night and we had our 2 year old with us. at check-in, we were upgraded to a suite with a lake view of lake michigan. it was beautiful. the suite had a king bed with a living room and a bar and mini-fridge which we didn't need, but if we were staying longer, it would have been a godsend. this hotel is in close proximity with grant park which has the beautiful buckingham fountain. we walked around the park and even saw a movie being filmed....but if you are looking for a hotel with a lot of restaurants around it, this isn't the one. we ended up eating at the irish pub inside the hotel (kitty o'shea's) which has great food. (we have stayed here before and always end up eating here.) there are a lot of attractions within a mile including the field museum, shedd aquarium, soldier field, and navy pier. they may not be walking distance but we could see them from our hotel window. overall, we had another wonderful stay at the chicago hilton. (our 4th stay) the only downside is the expensive parking within the hotel.....41 dollars a night is kind of ridiculous.

"i stayed at the millennium knickerbocker hotel for a fun weekend in chicago. the standard room had a nice king size bed that was nice and comfortable. i love a hotel with all white sheets because then i know it's clean. i really liked the simple and modern decor, especially the huge upholstered headboard. nice fixtures in the bathroom and granite counter. the bathroom was so much nicer than my own bathroom at home. the staff was friendly. can't really judge the service because i didn't have any problems or complaints. so i didn't have a reason to interact with the staff much. overall, it was a very nice hotel in a great location. will definitely stay here again on my next visit.

"i recently stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel. it was my first time staying at this hotel and, i am sorry to say, it was my last time staying there. one of my main issues with this hotel was the amount of noise. the walls must be very thin because lying in bed at night i could hear my neighbors in the next room talking. although i could not quite make out the words of their conversations, i could definitely hear their voices as more than just a murmer. in addition, i was awakened several times by people conversing in the hallway as they walked by my door, presumably on the way to their rooms. admittedly, i am a light sleeper, but this was ridiculous. if you decide to stay here, i suggest that you check your bill very carefully before check out. when i checked mine, i found that i was being charged a rate higher than the one that i was supposed to be charged. i had to wait in line at the front desk for someone to help me (and the front desk service is woefully slow) and finally had to ask to speak to a supervisor before the error could be corrected. finally, though i had been told upon check-in that my room had been recently updated, i cannot believe that statement was accurate. the room appeared to be rather dated in its furnishings and decor and the carpet appeared to be somewhat worn. all in all, i round my stay at this hotel to be disappointing. next time i will arrange to stay elsewhere.

"my husband and i stayed at the hotel allegro in chicago this past summer. needless to say we will not be returning! the hotel is very overpriced for what you get. upon arriving to the hotel the staff was very unfriendly and could not help with questions we had. the bed was very uncomfortable and the 'fully-stocked honor bar' was stocked with only a few choices. the shower did not even work!we booked the king suite with jacuzzi but ended up only getting a king room with no jacuzzi. i would not recommend this place!

"my wife and i recently stayed at the hotel monaco in chicago and, after our experience there, we will not be returning. with a hotel that markets itself as 'luxury,' we were expecting to get a big bang for our buck. we were disappointed, to say the least. first of all, we stayed in the king deluxe room and it was uncomfortably small. the space was used poorly - my wife and i could not walk around the bed at the same time because there was so little space. the decor seemed rather dated and not of the best quality. although they said our room woudl be ready at 3, we had to wait almost an hour past that for our room to be ready. although the staff did offer a complimentary drink as an apology, they didn't seem terribly upset or apologetic about the inconvenience this caused. the noise at night from the city is horrible - even with the radio on in our room we could hear traffic and pedestrians on the street well past midnight. the hotel would not move us to a different room. all in all, i felt that we paid $100.00 for a luxury hotel and got a $40 motel 6. we will definitely not be back anytime soon.

"my stay here was superb. the view from my windows was stunning, as i looked out i could see the beautiful grant park. the room had a nice airy feel but was also warm and inviting. the bed was very comfortable. the wireless internet was fast and effective which is nice especially when on business trips. the hotel is in walking distance to the museum which is nice for those on vaca. overall i thouroughly enjoyed my stay here.

"very centrally located in the loop directly south of the 7th day adventist church (my room looked down upon wacker drive, the aforementioned church and the chicago river. small room, virtually no storage space. attended a conference with the monaco as venue. they provided adequate service, with no problems. this was the first time i spent with a kimpton hotel and i registered for their frequent stay program. i never felt comfortable in this hotel. i'm 60 yrs old and it appears the clientele they target is half my age. rude front deskperson of unidentifiable gender. the young people can have at it. i'll stay at the marriott michigan ave next time.

"a very nice hotel with small but adequate rooms. the decor was lovely. my daughter and i spent 5-nights here, saw wicked just down the street and used the public transportation to get all around town. was a bit disappointed with the bar/restaurant which opened and closed it's kitchen at will without regard to posted hours. the room description boasted of safe's large enough to accomodate a laptop, so i brought mine. i was informed after check-in that the safes are not in every room (and not in mine). as a side note, i was surprised that nearly all the shops many restaurants closed at 6pm in that area... even the 7-11.

"my husband and i came to the ambassador east hotel for my sister's wedding. the hotel had been very helpful and professional in helping us coordinate a wedding with over 200 guests. when we arrived we were impressed by how organized they were, helping us check and get our guests situated. they were even nice enough to let us leave guest gift bags in each of our guest's rooms. our rooms were clean and beautifully appointed, with a view of the city. we held the rehearsal dinner/groomsman party in the pump room which has a gorgeous bar complete with celebrity photos on the wall. after my sister was married in a church downtown, we held the reception in the large banquet hall. again the hotel was great about shuttling all of our guests and helping us arrange dinner, the dj and all of the wedding's decorations. we had a great time. ambassador east hotel is highly recommended!

"we just returned from 4 nights at the ambassador east. what a gem! the location in the gold coast neighborhood is perfect for finding restaurants and walking the magnificent mile. there is a train station about 2 blocks away. the room was very comfortable, with nice amenities, and there is free internet service on the 2nd floor. best of all was the bell and lobby staff! they really went out of their way to be helpful and greeted us warmly each time we left and arrived. i would say that this was the nicest hotel staff i've encountered in all my travels.

"the sofitel chicago water tower, while seemingly a good idea in theory, has many drawbacks. at first glance, it appears quite luxurious and grand, but some of its shortcomings cannot be overlooked. the hotel is quite tall, coming in at 32 stories, and the noise from adjoining floors and rooms is sometimes quite annoying. the staff members do little to try to ameliorate the situation for the dissatisfied guest, so it seems as if your pleas for help go unnoticed. the hotel tries to adopt a french flavor, but its efforts fall short. the only real french influences are found in the names of restaurants and bars. the hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the city, but this location also adds to the less-than-cozy feel of the establishment. the same complaint about the guest rooms and noise applies to the hotel in general. the city's traffic and noise both detract from the ability to fully enjoy one's stay here. overall, i would not recommend this hotel. make a different choice.

"my husband and i snagged a great deal on a weekend trip to chicago, and decided (at the recommendation of friends) to stay at the palmer house hilton. the only word we can use to describe it is 'amazing'! walking into the lobby feels like stepping back in time, it is simply breath-taking. be sure to check out the ceiling, i have never seen one so beautiful outside of europe. we checked-in without any issues and were assigned a very lovely room with the most comfortable bed i have encountered in any hotel. everything is in walking distance of the palmer house, you couldn't hope to find a better location for exploring downtown chicago. everything was perfect with our stay here, i would not stay anywhere else in chicago from now on.

"i stayed at the millennium knickerbocker hotel for a total of three days, and through out my stay i had a wonderful time. the room was impeccably clean, as well as the pillows and sheets. the beds were large and extremely comfortable. the staff though, in my honest opinion, is what made my stay so pleasant. from the people at the check in, to the waiters at the restaurant, i got the best customer service. the hotel was also conveniently located. it was within walking distance to the shopping center. i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying at around the area in chicago.

"my wife and i stayed at the affinia chicago last week (in a studio suite, which was not worth the extra payment). it was an absolute nightmare! to begin with, the room is listed as 'oversized', when it's nothing of the sort. we've previously stayed in the hotel and the regular guest room is only about 2 square feet smaller. i believe the only extra space was in the closet, which isn't very useful unless you plan on living there! we had our two sons with us, so we had to make extra sleeping space. our oldest son slept on the couch and woke up multiple times in the time, complaining of bugs moving around. he must have been umcomfortable also, as i sat on the couch during the day and it was like a rock. the room service is horrible, they took 47 minutes to deliver a pillow for my wife around 10pm, and she had to wait up for that. my family would never go back to this hotel, and i highly recommend you also stay well away.

"booked a room w/ a queen bed for 2 nights for a wonderful nye, and was rather disappointed. bed was either the world's smallest queen, or was actually a double, not to mention it was uncomfortably springy. some of the things in the bathroom had been previously opened and used (q-tips). lots of noise seemed to carry through the vents as we could hear other rooms rather clearly. when the tv was off, there was a very audible high-pitched humming noise that we could not get rid of unless we unplugged the tv. hot water was very inconsistent in the shower. it is in a great location, however, next time i will try one of the other hotels in the area like the intercontinental or marriott. this might not be too bad if you are passing though quickly on business, but i wouldn't recommend it for a romantic night or two.

"first of all, expedia.com charged me for an additional person per my instructions but when i arrived at the hotel these monies were not included and the complimentary breakfast was not offered. the hotel service person who checked us in forgot to give me back my parking ticket but left a generic message for me stating that there was an envelope at the front desk. i had to wait in line for another 20 minutes to discover this the whole time this person was looking at me and never said a word!! i was charged and paid for parking adjacent to the hotel. when we went to leave the gate would not open. we had to find the parking garage office and the manager had to call several times over to the hotel until finally someone picked up. they confirmed my payment and then we were allowed to leave the structure. the hotel itself is beautiful!!! the bell hops and doormen were just wonderful. they were more than helpful and gracious but the internal staff were rude and not helpful at all!!!!

"i travelled to illinois from the uk on business, and booked friday and saturday night at the homewood suites so that i could have a weekend in the city. the location was perfect, walking distance to michigan ave for all the shopping and touristy stuff, and literally 100 yards to the l (red line) for getting out to the surrounding areas. the room was great: not exactly 'wow' decor but clean and really well stocked. i was expecting a 'suite' to be a larger than average hotel room with seperate sitting area. it was actually a 3-room mini-apartment, with an open lounge/kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. two flatscreen tvs and a huge bed. breakfast buffet eggs and bacon were great for the hangover(!), and the kitchen meant that i could cook up some lunch rather than eat out if needed.

"my daughter wanted to spend the weekend in chicago for her 21st birthday recently, and i wanted to find the best hotel for her experience. i looked at the hotel website and really like hotel allegro's insistence in supplying organic fare and in-room spa services, so i booked us for a friday and saturday night. upon arriving, the demeanor of the hotel staff was rude and distant. not enough to warrant a verbal complaint, but enough to make my daughter and i feel uneasy. after check-in, which took at least 20 minutes due to severe under-staffing, we headed to our room trying to be optimistic. our room was much smaller than the photos on the hotel site suggested, the sink faucet in the bathroom was leaky enough to make a constantly irritating sound, and we only had a stock of 2 towels, which were never replaced during our stay. we made sure to spend as much time exploring the city as possible just to avoid going back to the hotel. it was a huge disappointment, for me as the customer and for my daughter as the birthday girl. i highly discourage anyone from staying at this hotel. there are much better choices in the chicago area.

"my husband and i recently spent 3 nights at the ambassador east hotel. we will never stay at this hotel again. for the steep price we paid to stay there, we expected a friendly staff and clean room, which we did not get. first of all, the rooms are not clean. we found a few bugs in our room and the sheets did not look like they have been recently changed. when we reported this information to the hotel staff, they did not do anything to help us out. the staff is very unfriendly. also, there were no clean towels to use in the bathroom.

"the hotel is very impressive upon entering and the staff was very friendly, however we felt our room was very dated and worn looking. our air conditioning didn't seem to be working well, but we turned it down and thought that it would eventually... cool off. our first night was interrupted by a phone call at one a.m. that was a fax, it happened 4 times. by this time we realized that the air was not working again, so after fussing with the controls it did kick on. the next morning i mentioned to the concierge the issues with the phone, but didn't think to mention the issues with the air because it appeared to be working. after being out seeing the sites of chicago for several hours and being very hot we were looking forward to resting in a cool room before going to a show . our room was 78 degrees, i called and maintenience did come to check. after determining that the unit needed a motor it was another hour so we did not get to rest in a cool room before going out. i feel an offer should have been made to us by the hotel. also was very surprised that wifi was not a free service !! we will not be staying at the hilton on our next trip to chicago.

"we wanted a nice place to stay the night after dinner, theater, and my daughter's 21st birthday. this place certainly fit the bill. it was convenient to everything including the southshore railroad station. the staff were all friendly. their was a small wine reception in the lobby in the evening and starbucks coffee in the morning. ryan, the concierge, ordered flowers for my daughter and had a nice bowl of hershey kisses waiting for us when we arrived. we were upgraded to a suite and although they forgot to make up the sofa bed, they came promptly to get it set up when we called later. the window seats were beautiful as well and i enjoyed drinking my coffee in the morning and reading a book.

"i want to issue a travel-warning to folks who might sign up for the weekend deal they offer through travelzoo from time to time: the deal says 'free breakfast' included in the price. however, what they don't tell you, is that the breakfast consists of a cup of coffee and a bisquit (or two)! moreover, you need to ask for these 'tickets' at the lobby when you check in - they won't give them to you automatically! we stayed there over christmas '03, and we, and i noticed several guests who bought the same package, had a rather unpleasant experience! the hotel is nice though, if you don't consider their lousy service!

"my family booked five nitghts at the omni chicago for our upcoming spring break. we took advantage of a pre-paid, non-cancellable offer. we subsequently received a 'bed & breakfast' offer via email and immediately called the hotel to inquire whether we could switch our reservation (same dates, different offer). we called the 800' number and the customer services representative was so obnoxiously condescending and ignorant, we simply hung up. we had been looking forward to our vacation, but now i am not sure i made the right choice with this hotel. i should have paid closer attention to the reviews - the ritz, the four seasons, and the peninsula would have never treated us this way. i will post again after our stay on april 17th.

"i recently stayed at the homewood suites by hilton chicago downtown, and found it lacking in the quality of their service. the rooms are nice and well furnished, but the service lacks in some areas. some of the complimentary services include fast-speed wireless internet access, cardio-fitness and indoor pool, grocery shopping service and coffee, tea, hot chocolate or cider all day long in the lobby's 24 hour convenience shop. however the wireless internet was spotty at best with really slow speed at times, the indoor pool was far to cold in my opinion and the cardio equipment was left uncleaned. the grocery shopping service was alright, although a bit on the slow side and then finally the coffee and hot chocolate in the 24 hour convenience shop were both cold and overall of poor quality. rating this hotel on a scale of 1 to 5, i would give it a 3 at best.

"when we were stranded in chicago for two days since our flight home was canceled, our airline put us in touch with hotels.com who found us the room at the sheraton towers. after a long and frustrating day that ended up with us still in chicago, arriving at the sheraton was a joy. the entire staff was wonderful. the bell staff was great helping us (finally) let go of the heavy bags, jonathan at check in was very helpful and had us in a room which he upgraded for us in no time. we enjoyed the location and the facilities of this property during our unexpected stay and would highly recommend this location to others. we can't say enough about the staff. if we are in chicago in the future we will definitely return here!

"the hotel is beautiful. it is an excellent location. there was a few minor issues. the hotel is clearly geared toward the convention and business crowd. there were charges for almost everything, although i did not incur any of these. our room was a little small for the class of hotel, but not overwhelmingly small. not a true complaint, but the elevators were very slow. my comparison was that we stayed in an equally aged hotel in a different city during our trip, and the intercontinental's were significantly slower. that's it, no more little nit picks. the staff was excellent, the doormen being the highlight. the hotel bar was also very nice. the hotel was immaculately clean. i would definitely travel to this hotel again.

"this hotel has a good name and a good location in chicago. unfortunately i was very unsatisfied with this hotel. this is a luxury hotel, so you are paying luxury prices. so, i expect to get my money's worth. unfortunately that was not the case at the intercontinental. firstly, my room was surprisingly small and unclean and could probably use a renovation and an upgrade in the furniture. again, this is supposed to be a luxury hotel, and it's expensive. i shouldn't be worried about why the carpet and other parts of the room seem dirty. i also had trouble getting the room to the temperature i wanted. i'm not sure if there was just a problem with the air condition in my room or if it's a problem in the whole hotel. the building is old and i suppose it has a lot of problems from being old. secondly, i was disappointed with the quality of the service from the hotel's staff. i thought they were somewhat rude and inattentive. thirdly, this hotel has a lot of additional expenses. i felt like they wanted to overcharge me every chance they got (use of the fitness amenities, internet, etc). when i'm already paying so much for a hotel room, i get very irritated when i feel i'm being nickel-and-dimed every chance they get. this hotel has a nice looking building, and again, it's in a terrific location. but i really don't think it's worth the expense. there are so many other hotels in chicago to choose from that are so much better.

"as a frequent traveler to chicago, i generally stay at the sutton court, but thought i would try a different boutique hotel. i will never stay at this hotel again. the first room they brought me to -- their standard room -- was a glorified closet, leaving me absolutely claustrophobic! actually the smallest hotel room i've been in in the u.s! i complained to the front desk, who then moved me to a 'premium' room -- still quite small, but manageably so. the bathroom was tiny, without a vanity, making it difficult to put your toiletries in the room. the location leaves much to be desired, as my room looked out directly onto the el (elevated subway - background noise), and the street was pretty deserted on a sunday evening. i will say that the free wi-fi was great. if you can find a chain or other hotel closer to michigan avene, i'd highly recommend you take that. if you want a nice room in a great location, check out sutton place hotel instead.

"spent two nights at the intercontinental on a business trip. this is a tremendous, towering hotel in one of the best locations in chicago -- right on the magnificent mile and superbly convenient for shopping and well placed for the business area. my room was in the historic tower -- a 1920s masonic club which has been converted at enormous expense. the effort has been worthwhile. my room was very large and well furnished, with a beautiful bathroom which contained a separate shower cubicle. it had breathtaking views down michigan avenue. there is a superb recreation centre (with an impressive swimming pool) beautiful bars and a good restaurant, zest, that serves a great breakfast. there is wifi in the rooms ($9.95 per day) and tea and coffee making facilities. no trouser press, but there is an ironing board and iron. the staff is friendly and anxious to please. i recommend this hotel in the strongest possible terms. it's expensive, but it will be difficult to find a better one in chicago.

"the sofitel water tower was a wonderful place to stay for my husband and me for our 20th anniversary weekend trip to chicago. we got married in the city but then moved away, and it was so romantic to return. we loved how near the sofitel was to everything - the magnificent mile was just outside our door, and we could walk to navy pier and other attractions as well. chicago has changed, but the sofitel made it feel like home again... except a very plush and elegant version of home! we stayed in a junior suite, which had great views of the city, and room service was very attentive when we called for champagne after midnight the day we arrived. both nights before leaving for supper, we had a cocktail in le bar and enjoyed talking about what we'd done during the day, and all the great memories this town has for us. but i have to say we have some new great memories now, thanks to the sofitel water tower!

"if you are looking for a true luxury experience, hotel monaco chicago is not the place to go. i stayed here while visiting friends and decided to treat myself to a luxury experience. i did not get it. check in was not a pleasant experience. the wait was long and the front desk staff were unfriendly and unhelpful. the room was ok, no roaches or anything, but it was small and cramped. and the mirrored headboard on my bed was more tacky motel than fancy hotel. the house cleaning service was really pushy and tried to clean my room at 8:30a in the morning. when i asked them to come back later, they gave me a whole 15 minutes before they came back. and getting extra towels was like pulling teeth. i don't know if they thought i was going to steal them or what. the room service food that i ordered was fine, but it took forever to be delivered and was half-cold by the time i received it. when i called the front desk to complain, they apologized, but did not offer to compensate me or send me new food. they have a restaurant at the hotel, but i did not bother to try it. the prices were ridiculous, the menu was limited, and my room service experience assured me it was not worth the hassel. i was really disenchanted with this experience. at $400 plus dollars a night, i received mediocre accomedations and poor service. spend your hard-earned money somewhere else.

"at the intercontinental chicago, you pay for more than a room. you pay for an experience. let me elaborate. i was a bit reluctant to pay a premium for location and amenities. like any novice traveller to chicago, i saw the mass glut of cheap accommodations out in the suburbs, and those were originally what i set my sights on. price is a powerful signal, and the sheer discount of those options drew me in. but after doing a bit of research, i realised that distance does have its costs. the price of transit in the chicagoland area isn't free. and it's far from what i'm used to. car use is price prohibitive. (i knew that originally, which is why i wasn't going to drive.) but the sting of using the automobile (parking, congestion, toll roads, etc.) gets shoved off onto taxi fares and auto rental. so, i ultimately had to end up looking for a place well connected with mass transit. but mass transit has its costs too, which meant that staying at a focal point downtown had its advantages. that's what originally drew me to intercontinental. but intercontinental is much more than the right room at the right place. the decor of the rooms and the amenities available to the guest are unsurpassable. i was travelling on international business, so the ease with which i could transact in foreign currency was a draw. (they had a currency exchange right there on the premises.) and the fact that massages, dry cleaning, and event planning were available in-house was a huge plus. my work gets me tied up in knots. it also leaves little time for doing chores. so the ability to grab a massage while my suits were being finished was a relief for me. but, on top of all that, the event planning was what put intercontinental over the top. being able to coordinate a comprehensive tour of chicago while completing my business and managing my personal life was a weight off my shoulders--and something i won't forget. in the end, if you're a newcomer to chicago staying in a time-crunch, the intercontinental is for you. the pricetag of rooming downtown can seem prohibitive, but when you factor in the convenience and savings in marginal costs, it's nothing in the end. and the intercontinental is not only price-competitive with the other downtown options, it also makes staying downtown the convenience and thrill it should be.

"stayed at the chicago affinia dec 10 thru dec 12 and was very impressed with the staff, the room, and the location. close to shopping and the pizza place next door was great. of course, there were many other restaraunts nearby as well. i had a little trouble figuring out the heat, but it was fine once i learned how to set it. they were working on the hotel, so we got a great rate. but the work never bothered us. the room was great, with the walk-in shower in the spacious bathroom a wonderful surprise. i would definately stay here again and would recommend to others.

"for starters, i had trouble reaching the front desk. every time i called it would ring endlessly! when finally i did reach someone, she was snooty, impolite, and altogether unhelpful. being from the south and not knowing anything about chicago i was hoping the staff would have been more helpful in guiding me around such a large metropolitan area. as i was there on business, i was really looking forward to the wi-fi access so that my business activity would go uninterrupted. unfortunately, this was not the case. after multiple log in attempts i ended up going to a local 'internet bar.' as attractive as the rooms and the hotel itself were, the complete and utter lack of service and delivering up to expectations was disappointing.

"stayed at the fitzpatrick before, about 4 years ago, it was ok. the management was great, staff was so kind, and rooms were clean. ** but this time i promised my self never to go back!! the new staff was so rude!! i made a reservation for my anniversary on the internet, and the day of check in i was told by the hotel staff that they do not have my reservation!** 1) i was transferred around back and forth from the hotel staff to the reservations hotline. 2) staff was extremely rude! not arrogant, but rude! like they hated thier job. 3) they offered check in at 1pm but the room wasn't ready till 3pm! 4) there were stains everywhere! 5) because of the high sales of rooms due to popularity on this site, they must have hired a cheap unfriendly staff.

"hi ho hi ho, off to chicago we go. here's the skinny, if you're hoping to run into a washed up rock star (cece deville for us, and no the teenagers had no idea who he was) you may want to spend your hard earned money here. i took my younger sister and a couple of her friends (teenagers) for an overnighter in chicago on our way to wisconsin. i chose the hard rock for the ambiance. i mean come on it is supposed to be 'cool'. well it wasn't. the positives: *it is in the carbon & carbide building, which is beautiful. *the location: it sits in the middle of everything *the lobby has two computers for guest use. *the fitness center is very nice. cardio machines have individual tv's and there are head phones in case you forgot yours. they have protein bars for those that like them for a post workout snack. *check-in and out was quick and valet was very courteous. the negatives: *the rooms were small and ours wasn't clean (pistachio shells on the floor). the rooms were painted purplish gray (we were on the prince floor) with a picture of bob marley hanging on one of the walls. the girls thought the coolest part about the hotel was the fuzzy throw pillows. *bathroom had only a shower and not a full tub. *the cable reception was poor; i kept looking for the bunny ears to fix the picture. *it isn't anywhere near the hard rock cafe. *there was very little memorabilia. *there is no pool, and yes i knew this when i made the reservation. to wrap it up, i won't be staying here again. if i am going to drop almost 4 benjamins on a hotel room, i will stay at the palmer house hilton. but that is a whole different review.

"my $200 gucci sunglasses were stolen out of my bag on the 16th. i filed a report with the hotel security and am anxious to hear back from them. this was such a disappointment, as we liked the hotel and were having a great time in chicago. our room was really nice, with 2 bathrooms. we had 2 double beds and a comfortable hideaway bed. we had a great view of the lake and park. the hotel charged us $25 to check in early (10am).

"we stayed for a one night getaway with family on a thursday. triple aaa rate of 173 was a steal. 7th floor room complete with 44in plasma tv bose stereo, voss and evian water, and gorgeous bathroom(no tub but was fine for us) concierge was very helpful. you cannot beat this location... only flaw was breakfast was pricey and service was very very slow(2hours for four kids and four adults on a friday morning) even though there were only two other tables in the restaurant. food was very good so it was worth the wait. i would return in a heartbeat. a gem in chicago...

"we stayed here as an alternative spot for a friend's wedding. the price was about 50% to 65% of what it costs to stay at similar hotels in the area. first the minuses. 1.) the standard rooms are small. if you want a little more space you might want to upgrade. 2.) since the hotel has been recently rehabbed you can see some of the stuff that the covered or painted. 3.) there really are no views from the hotel. now the plusses. 1.) the shower is awesome. probably one of the best hotel showers i've seen. rain shower with wand, great pressure and the enclosure didn't leak like a lot of these shower stalls do. very nice. 2.) the fixtures and finishes in the rooms were top notch. very modern and clean. 3.) the bed was great. better than some hotels that promote their beds. great nights sleep. overall. this is a great space for a trip where you are not going to be spending much time in the room. if you were in town for a conference or for work where you will need to spread out your stuff it might not work. anyone else should really like the experience. all i care about when i travel is having a nice bed and a good shower to relax in after a long day. if you are the same this is a good spot for you.

"i had heard good things regarding the plush accomidations at the talbott hotel in chicago. i thought it would be a special treat to take my 13 year old daughter to spend a weekend with mom, shopping and enjoying a bit of chicago's exciting night life. i found the talbott hotel's website and decided the american girl package they offer was what i was looking for. the price sounded reasonable, so i booked a room. the two of us were so very excited to spend some time together. we arrived at the hotel to check-in at 5:00 on that friday afternoon. after making us wait for 15 minutes while trying to find my reservation they informed me the room wouldn't be available for another hour. they blamed this on shortage of maids that day. they did manage to find us a table in one of their cafe's but this wasn't a good start to our special weekend. when we were finally allowed to go to our room we found that the doll-sized travel bed that is included in the package wasn't in the room. this disappointed my daughter, she was looking forward to that. while they did find a bed and bring it to us it just wasn't the surprise we had imagined. the rest of the weekend went by fairly smoothly. we managed to have a good time together even though the service wasn't quite what is claimed on the website. would i go to the talbott hotel again? probably not.

"my first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews. for some reason, i kept being disappointed at every turn. noisy room on the 4th floor. could not get the room to cool down - it was stifling. be warned - no water, no mini-bar no vending machine, no nothing once you get in your room. you might as well be in prison. they have coffee in the morning, but it starts at 6 so i had to wait both days. i guess that is convenient for them, but what about me? workout facility - pretty small but not the smallest. the only treadmill i could get on was broken. guess what a cooler with water in it! oh no - it was only stocked for one day. after that nothing. way to set expectations and then fail to deliver. same with towels - one day they have them - next day they don't. they essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous $10 charge for wireless (go a few doors down to starbucks where it is free). they should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach. i have stayed at much better for less. won't be coming back.

"the room itself was fine and comfortable(very peaceful), but the customer service by the so-called, concierge or 'experience something or the others' left much to be desired. first, i arrived and the doorman walked me to the desk. i was not greeted with the usual 'hello, welcome to...'. instead, i got, 'your name? id?' no, 'hello', no 'welcome to the amalfi hotel,' just plain old poor customer service from the very beginning! that left a very bad taste in my mouth, but i decided to let it go and see how the rest of my stay was.

"we loved this hotel and would definitely come back. initially we weren't given a goldfish, which was disappointing, but then we left a tip for the housekeeper, and she rewarded us with one. we had fun sipping wine and playing wii in the lobby every afternoon. the staff were quite friendly and helpful, even printing our boarding passes for us. our room was very comfortable, with a cozy little alcove at the window where we read the paper. at first we were worried about noise, since our room was next to the elevator, but we hardly heard it, and didn't notice any street noise either. the hotel is colorfully and tastefully decorated, well-lit, and ideally located.

"do you imagine getting there for the first time and overlooking the room, that was supposed to be ready, with used towels and the mouthwash opened and used? what about when they left the towel for the floor (the foot towel) to dry my face? what about the slippers that, although being still in the bag, had all the sole broken and left tiny plastic parts over the way to the garbage (all over the room, de facto). i didn't realise that would happen to me until i saw paris hilton on tv and then i knew god is great and he did it to us for being such an idiots to go to a company that has been able to create her. shame on us, actually!

"since this was our first visit to the 'windy city,' we wanted to stay somewhere that was central and unique. we read many great reviews regarding the kimpton brand so we gave it a go. the 'go' ended up being a 'no go.' we were sorely disappointed. when we arrived the ladies at the front desk were very nice. we have two kids with us, so we needed a crib for our 6 month baby. we were told 'no problem.' unfortunately, it took them about 1 or 2 hours to get us the crib and we were in a lurch as to what to do next. then, we noticed a bug (or bugs) near the fridge area. yikes! we called downstairs to complain and to be switched to a different room (or floor!). our request was met about 30 minutes later. by this time, we were so tired from the flight and the first impressions, we almost wanted to throw the towel in. customer service was so lacking! we wanted to get settled and go grab a bit in the city, but had to wait around for our new room and the crib. this is not what we expected at all for this high price! will have to think hard before we book with a kimpton hotel again.

"i was not at all impressed with my stay at the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago. checking in there were two people ahead of me but apparently that takes the 1 (one!!) front desk agent 30 minutes to process. both guests had issues with their rooms regarding, it seemed, wrong room types and being out of the room type requested. i was nervous about my own reservation and, sure enough, my superior corner room wasn't available. the hotel tried to compensate me with complimentary breakfast and drinks at the bar but it is still annoying to reserve a room type and not have it be available. i was also annoyed that every little thing has an upcharge at the hotel. want internet? upcharge. want extra pillows? upcharge. extra coffee for the room? upcharge. bad enough to get that treatment on the airline ride over but to have a hotel nickle and dime you is very annoying and aggravating. i won't be back and would strongly recommend other travelers to beware before booking.

"it was my first time to visit chicago and i would say, i'd definitely go back, not just because of the air and water show that we really enjoyed, but most importantly, because of the hotel that we stayed in. the millennium knickerbocker is not just accommodating to their human guests, but with pets too. at first i was reluctant that they will give us accommodations because of my pet dog, but i was surprised it turned out the other way. i've experienced being denied reservations because of my dog and that's really frustrating, it's just nice that there still are other hotels that are pet friendly. i would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends if they plan to visit chicago.

"the air-condition has a noisy fan/compressor in each room. it starts every 3 to 5 min and the noise will wake you up. at least the first night. this is an old fashion system that needs to be replaced. the postal service at the hotel is non-working. the hotel messed up our concert tickets that was correctly addressed and transported by ups. the tickets were at the hotel general managers office. the reception denied that they had arrived. we had to spend most of a day travelling to the ticket agent to resolve it. the hotel did not find any reason to apologize for the inconvenience. the concert was the reason for our travel to chicago. else, the hotel had good standard, free internet in the lobby, not to good view from the rooms, and friendly staff at the restaurants and the bars. we had booked 20 room-nights all together staying at room 612, 425 and 431 from the 23rd june.

"the room i booked a room here and was told i'd be getting a king bed. when i check in, they say they only have a queen bed room available. i protested to no avail. when i got to the room, it was really only a full size bed. so i went from from a king bed at home to a full size bed in a tiny broom closet of a room in chicago. for the pleasure, i paid the same price as a normal king bed room. the full size bed we had was also extremely uncomfortable. i think it was lop sided because they never rotate the mattresses. we would wake up with body aches and headaches. my wife even said she lost feeling in her arms some nights. not good. also, the internet in the room is hard to set-up, slow to use, and inconsistent. i generally had to restart my computer at least once to get the internet to work. the internet worked one day on my iphone and then would not log me in. it's not really worth it. room service room service was very inconsistent and nonsensical. some mornings they would take our towels (even the ones we hung up to use again) and not replace them, other times they would replace some towels and not others. they would also come at vastly different times. hotel service this hotel loves to nickel and dime. i asked for a fridge in the room and they told me it'd be $25. no other hotel i've ever stayed in (regardless of how many stars it had) has ever charged me for a fridge in the room. late checkout? charge. shuttle from the airport? - nonexistent. the front deck 'gold passport' people can't even figure out how to get you points. in the end i will have to call corporate and get my points for my stay (not that i plan on staying at a hyatt property again). by the way, apparently the hotel is still undergoing changes because my mini-bar was missing. i was thinking of using it as a fridge instead of paying $25. the hotel the hotel has some cool bars and a beautiful lobby area in the east tower. the west tower has some underground amenities no one uses. the bars are extremely expensive, but the drinks are tasty. the food is edible too, but i wouldn't brag about it. the hotel is not directly on the main street (michigan), but it's not too far from it. it's right next to the boat tours and, in some rooms, has a view of the navy pier. our room faced another hotel, but we could see a sliver of the pier. the hotel is walking distance from millennium park. it's a bit of a walk to any of the l stations though. if you want a wonderful breakfast place, go to wildberry on randolph st. it'll have you waiting to eat for a long time, but it's yummy! conclusion i get better rooms, better beds, better service, and better amenities at a holiday inn express or a best western. save the money and stay elsewhere.

"we stay at the palmer house when we attend conferences in chicago. it is a stately building. but this year, there were ... problems we have not had before. first, they now have wi-fi available, but it is not free. the cost is $7.50 per hour. on-line it indicated that hilton hotels charge about $4, but this was almost double. many hotels have free wi-fi. wi-fi is wi-fi, so the level of service is not a factor that could justify this exorbitant cost. they also charge for their fitness center, even when you are only going to use the machines. there is no business center in-house for copies, etc. our bed was against a wall that separated us from the bathroom in the next room. it did not separate us from the bathroom noises. when someone took a shower (at 5:30 a.m.), the pipes 'sung' like old pipes do,but very loudly. an empty wine glass sat outside someone's room door for days without being picked up by housekeeping. the concierge desk had only one person and there was always a line. if you called down, you were put on hold while they dealt with the people in the line. the staff were all very nice, and the location can't be beat, but the luxury prices for normal services felt like a ripoff this year. i doubt we'll return....

"my wife and i decided to stay at the amalfi while we visited friends in chicago; we will not stay here again nor would we recommend this 'luxury' hotel to any of our friends. amalfi claims that your stay begins with a 'warm greeting,' but we received the exact opposite. the front desk clerk was rude, sighed and rolled her eyes anytime we asked her a question, and became agitated when asked for a pet friendly room. apparently there was extra work for her since we had to change our reservations and add our dog, who we had to bring at the last minute. the room on the pet floor was alright, nothing spectacular, and unfortunately had a slight scent of covered-up dog urine. we proceeded to dinner at keefer's restaurant and had to wait an additional 45 minutes past our reservation time. i have my suspicions we were segregated upon because of our casual attire; opposed to the elegant environment that was prominent throughout the restaurant. the next day, i could not get the wireless in the room to work correctly, and had to finish some work at our friend's house. my wife had called for some extra towels and pillows, which took about half an hour to receive. she also ordered breakfast because breakfast in bed was her favorite- until the eggs that showed up had a long black hair in them. we were set to stay for 3 days, but only managed to stay 2. we will not be staying here again.

"my recent stay at the talbott hotel in chicago was miserable. my visit began on the wrong foot when they couldn't locate my reservation. i had my reservation code and the email confirmation but they insisted they couldn't find me 'in the system'. we finally agreed to scrap that reservation and start over. that process was lengthy as they were training a new girl on how to take reservations. the room that i had originally reserved (king) was not available and i had to wait 45 minutes for them to clean a double room. i was so tired from the traveling and the hassle at the front desk that i decided to stay in and order room service. it took an hour and a half for my food to arrive. when finally delivered, it was cold and not exactly how i had ordered it. so now i am cranky, tired and starving! i ate what i could from the mini bar (poor selection of items) and went to bed. the room was spacious but had a stale smell to it, as if someone had smoked in it. the next morning i complained and wanted to change rooms. the woman at the front desk couldn't be bothered with me and didn't try to make things right in any way. i decided to check out and go to another hotel for the remainder of my stay in chicago. i will never waste my time or money at the talbott again.

"traveled to this hotel on a family vacation. we chose this hotel because it was pet friendly. upon arrival we smelled just how pet friendly it was! the dog that greets you attacked my dog. there was constant barking throughout the night and during breakfast, i found hair in my eggs! i would not recommend this hotel!

"at the last minute, my son and i decided to take a quick trip to chicago to see the cubs. after checking priceline i decided to book the omni because of the great price for airfare and hotel. we arrived at the hotel around noon and our room was ready(i had called ahead and requested early arrival).the front desk treated us like we were there best customers-very friendly and accomodating. the room was wonderful with all the modern conviences you would expect in an upscale hotel. the room was spotless and the bed was very comfortable. there was not one sign of bed bugs as mentioned in a previous review-maybe those bed bugs were from their luggage and were transferred into their room!!!we then went to the hotel restaurant and had lunch. our service was great as was the food. we also tried several restaurants around the omni-all within walking distance. the service, cleanliness and location of the omni were incredible. we will definitely go back.

"i stayed with my husband at the homewood suites in chicago. we wanted to do something nice for our anniversary and thought that the hilton was a solid name brand and expected to have a pleasant stay. unfortunately this was not the case! the staff was very rude at check-in (which took 20 minutes) and the lobby smelled musky and gross. the room itself was not like other hilton hotels i have stayed at. the carpeting was atrocious and the color of vomit, the room smelled of smoke (even though it's advertised as smoke-free) and there were a few long brown hairs in our bed! i was so grossed out that i had to call down to the rude staff to ask for our linens to be changed and they gave us a huge attitude about it. and don't even get me started on how poorly the shower/bathtub worked..a nice anniversary went totally awry due to how crummy this hotel is. if i could give it 0 stars, i would!

"the james hotel in chicago was a huge let down. i was expecting a truly spectacular experience. on the website it appears to be an absolutely fabulous state of the art hotel. well, my family's bad experience started right when we walked in the door. it turns out the room we had reserved had been given to someone else, and the man at the front desk was extremely rude. we had to wait for an hour for the house keeping service to prepare a new room for us. the room had an odd smell and we had to ask for towels and hand soap as they weren't already in the room. the one thing that was good about the place was the fabulous gym. all in all, i feel that we paid way too much for what we got. next time i will look to stay somewhere else.

"set up an important meeting for some clients at the hard rock hotel chicago. they were flying to chicago for a special trip to checkout the music scene and to discuss business with my company. naturally, they wanted to stay here. the client really seemed to like their rooms, but felt the paul reed smith room was too cramped for our day-long meeting (330 sq ft.). in a panic, i contacted the hrh staff and they actually had another, bigger, room available. we quickly moved our meeting in the birdland room for the rest of the day and the meeting was a rousing success. (birdland room is 660 sq ft.) we have a new client and so does hrh. this is where the client wants to stay every time they fly in for future business meetings with us.

"the amalfi hotel advertises itself as a 'luxury boutique hotel' and as such i expected my experience there to be somewhat better than average. unfortunately, this was not the case. the room i booked was not clean; in particular the bathroom looked as if someone had done a very minimal amount of cleaning after the last guest. there was hair in the corners of the room leading me to think the floor had not been swept or cleaned. in addition, although the room was supposed to be a non-smoking room, i could still detect the odor of cigarette smoke. i will say that the staff was courteous and the hotel is very well situated in terms of the many restaurants, sites and shops all within walking distance. however, given the cost of the room and my experience with the cleanliness of the room, i would not stay at the amalfi hotel again.

"i stay at this hotel 2 times a year on business and love it! the staff are great, the rooms are spacious and clean, and the location is perfect for shopping and dining on michigan ave. plus if you sign up for omni select membership (for free) you get free wireless internet access.

"i recently stayed at the fairmont chicago and found it to be a fantastic hotel. staff was always courteous and helpful - from the front desk staff at check-in to wait staff in aria restaurant, to the maid who cleaned my room. the rooms were recently updated, with large flat-screen tv's, beautiful linens, and exceptional toiletries in each room. my room even had a view of monroe st. harbor. it is truly a first-rate hotel. location is south of the river and east of michigan ave -- as we normally stay north of the river it seems a little out of the way (if that's possible in downtown chicago), however its location significantly lowers street noise. the hotel has excellent access to millennium park, the aon center (there is a connecting concourse), and is about 4 blocks from shopping on north michigan ave. i ate dinner in aria and it was fantastic! room service for breakfast was quite good as well. overall, i'd stay again in a minute if i had business in the loop, or leisure plans in millennium or grant parks.

"i stayed here for business and loved it. got it for $93 inc tax on priceline, an incredible deal for this hotel. if i wasn't on priceline i would expect to pay $200 per night (maybe more) for this location/level of service. it's in the heart of downtown chicago, walkable to many locations. the lobby is very impressive, the room was very nice. no complaints at all, from check-in to check-out. i was alone so didn't go to the bar but it looked like people were really enjoying themselves. it was full of people all the time. i want to stay here when i come back with my husband for a fun weekend in the city.

"during my stay at the hilton chicago it has been quite unpleasant. how so you might ask? well ill tell you, the towels where scratchy and the service was terrible and by terrible i mean they weren't even at the desk when i checked in. also, when i ordered my breakfast, lunch, and dinner from room service i received the wrong order for all meals and felt a little sick after lunch. finally, the bill was charging me for stuff i didn't want or ask for. but overall the hotel was very bad and unpleasant for me and others. i give it a half a star.

"my wife and i just returned from a 3 night stay at the amalfi hotel in chicago and enjoyed everything about the hotel. most importantly our room was perfect with plenty of space, great jazz cd's in the room, wonderful bathroom and one of the most comfortable beds i've ever slept in. the staff was very helpful with every request. the amalfi offers a great continential breakfast on every floor each morning with good coffee and a great selection of pastry's, fruit's and jucie's. we also enjoyed the managers receptions one evening where they offer a great choice of complementary cocktails and antipasta's for their guests. would highly recommend this hotel.

"our first visit to chicago and i really cannot wait to go back. the hotel was in a great location and every member of staff we had contact with were exceptionally helpful. particular mention should go to the door staff who were amazingly helpful. the room was clean, quiet and spacious, if only every hotel were like this.
